            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> 
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Evils that ariſe from the neglect of Family-Inſtruction: Whence it proceeds that Family-Inſtruction is neglected. Five Arguments to prove it to be a Duty. The Inſtructions we give our Families muſt be drawn out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Servants as well as Children muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Mothers as well as Fathers muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Children.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe neglect of Family-Inſtruction is a great and yet a common Evil: The ſad effects thereof, ſuch as the decay of the power of Godlineſs, groſs ignorance, undutiful and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Children, evil and unfaithful Servants, the growth and increaſe of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo plain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102523:11"/>almoſt in all places, that he that runneth may read them. Neither is it the preſent Generation only, which is corrupted through the careleſneſs of thoſe Parents and Maſters of Families who neglect to train up their Children and Servants in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of God; but hereby ignorance and iniquity are like to be propagated unto, and greatly increaſed in, the Generations which are yet to come. For when God ſhall give thoſe Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who were trained up without Inſtruction, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of their own, it is moſt probale that they will neglect to teach their Children and Servants, and that the ſucceeding Generations which ſhall ſpring out of their Loyns, will tread in their Fathers ſteps, and ſo vice and ignorance will deſcend from one Family to an other for many generations. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ground and cauſe of this evil, whence it cometh to paſs that Family-Inſtruction is ſo much neglected, I conceive the reaſon of moſt, if not of all mens neglect of this Duty, may be reduced to one of theſe four heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either they are not convinced that it is their Duty to inſtruct their Families.</p>
               <p>Or 2. Though they know it to be their Duty, they want an heart to ſet about the performance of it.</p>
               <p>Or 3. Though they are willing to inſtruct their families, yet they know not how to ſet about this work, at leaſt they know not how to carry it on in an advantageous ſucceſsful manner, and therefore leave it undone.</p>
               <p>Or 4. They have gotten certain pleas, whereby they think to excuſe their neglect of this work. Wherefore in this enſuing Treatiſe, the deſign whereof is to excite parents and maſters of families
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102523:11"/>to train up their children in the knowledge and obedience of the Scriptures, I ſhall do theſe four things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall prove it is the duty of parents and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of families to inſtruct their children and ſervants in the knowledge, and to train them up in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the word of God.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall produce ſome motives to excite thoſe who neglect this work of Family-inſtruction, to be diligent, conſtant, and conſcientious, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty in teaching and inſtructing their families.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall give ſome directions how this work of family-inſtruction may be carried on ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the converſion, edification, and eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as are under our charge.</item>
                  <item>4. I ſhall anſwer the moſt material Pleas and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are brought againſt training up our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the knowledge of the Scriptures, whereby many perſons are either kept from, or diſcouraged in the performance of this work.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe, namely to prove, that it is the duty of all Parents and Maſters of Families to teach the Scriptures unto their Children and Servants, and to train up their Families in the knowledge and obedience of the Word of God.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> WE have many plain and expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments from God, wherein the Lord ſtraightly chargeth all Parents and Maſters of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102523:12"/>families to teach his word unto their children and ſervants, and requireth them to be very diligent therein. I ſhall mention ſome places both out of the old and alſo out of the new Teſtament, where we have expreſs commands from God for the teaching his word to our children, and prove that under the name of Children, are comprehended our Servants, and all the Members of the Family: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> This being a full and pregnant Text for proving the point in hand, I ſhall obſerve ſeveral things from it:</p>
                  <p>1. What it is which we are to teach our children, and that is the word of God; <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day—thou ſhalt teach them unto thy Children.</hi> The Apoſtle gives this commendation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is <hi>profitable for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. and intimates to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18. That the Jews drew their inſtructions which they gave to thoſe whom they taught, out of the Law of God: <hi>Behold thou art called a Jew, and knoweſt his will, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveſt the things that are more excellent, being inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Law of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Obſerve who they are whom God commands to teach his word unto their Children, and you ſhall find that this Charge is not given to the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> but to all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The Lord calls out twice to the whole Body of the People, <hi>Hear O Iſ ael,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Hear O Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 4. If it had been ſaid, <hi>Hear O Houſe of Aaron,</hi> or <hi>Hear O ye Sons of Levi,</hi> we might have thought it had ſpecial reference to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Word; but when this charge is uſhered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102523:12"/>in with a double Call to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to give audience, no man can ſay, This Command of teaching Gods word to my Children, belongeth not unto me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be one that is and reſolveth to continue an alien to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I may adde further, that this charge, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto thy Children,</hi> is given to the ſame perſons that are commanded to love God with all their hearts, verſ. 5. and to the ſame perſons that are enjoyned to treaſure up Gods word in their hearts, verſ. 6. So that every one that is obliged to love God, and to lay up Gods word in his heart, is obliged alſo, if he be one unto whom God hath given Children, to teach Gods word unto his Children.</p>
                  <p>3. Take notice what is meant by teaching Gods word unto our Children: It implies, 1. That we ſhould train them up in the knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: To teach, is to convey knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.66. <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowledge;</hi> and to this effect the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tranſlation renders theſe words, <hi>Expones ea filiis tuis,</hi> Thou ſhalt expound them unto thy Children, thou ſhalt cauſe them to underſtand the ſenſe and meaning of my word. 2. To teach our Children the Scriptures, is to train them up in the obedience and practice of thoſe things which the Lord requireth of us in his holy word: There is a teaching to do, as well as to know the will of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will.</hi> Matr. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> 2 Chron. 6.27. <hi>Thou haſt taught them the good way wherein they ſhould walk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Obſerve in what manner, and when we are to teach Gods word unto our Children; this work muſt not be done in a ſlight ſuperficial manner, but with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102523:13"/>all diligence; <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children.</hi> And as for the times and ſeaſons when we are to teach them, <hi>Moſes</hi> intimates, that it muſt not be ſeldom, but this work muſt be done frequently, we ſhould embrace all convenient ſeaſons to be drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſome portion of Gods word into them,—<hi>Thou ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. We have the perſons deſcribed whom we are to inſtruct out of the word of God, and they are our Children, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children:</hi> Now under the name of Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended our Servants, and all others in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that need inſtruction, as ſhall be ſhewed more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Another Scripture wherein God commands us to teach his word unto our Children, we have in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 6, 7. <hi>He eſtabliſhed a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our fathers that they ſhould make them known unto their Children, that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his Commandments.</hi> Here we may obſerve,
<list>

                  </p>
                  <p>4. In all Religious Exerciſes we find Governours of Families enjoyned to regard with an equal care their Children and their Servants, whether they be Men or Maid Servants. As for inſtance, in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbath, they are commanded to look after their Servants, and them that ſojourn with them, as well as their Children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſabbath to keep it holy—In it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter, thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy ſtranger that is within thy Gates.</hi>—So alſo in the celebration of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the whole Family was to keep the Feaſt unto the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy feaſt, thou, and thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man ſervant and thy maid ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Inſtruction is as neceſſary for, and will be as beneficial to our Servants as our Children, (as ſhall be ſhewed afterwards) and therefore we ſhould not think much to beſtow our pains in teaching them ſuch things as are neceſſary to ſalvation: Seeing 1. They have immortal Souls, which are as precious to <hi>God</hi> as our own Souls, or the Souls of our Children, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Behold all Souls are mine.</hi>— 2. Jeſus Chriſt hath done as great things for our Servants as he hath done for us or our Children; He died for them as well as for us; He makes the Bond as well as the Free Members of his Body, and Partakers of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102523:17"/>his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one Spirit we are all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be bond or free, and have been made to drink into one Spirit:</hi> He makes no diſtinction of Bond or Free, in the communication of his benefits; but the bond man and the free man are all one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 3. God the Father will do as great things for our ſervants, as he will for us or our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if they ſeek and ſerve him, he will give them his Spirit, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.29. <hi>And alſo upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in thoſe days I will pour out my Spirit:</hi> He will give them an inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22, 24. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Maſters according to the fleſh—knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance.</hi> John 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be</hi> — He will give them all good things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> Shall we think much to ſpend a little time, and to take a little pains in teaching our Servants, when God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, doth ſuch great things for them?</p>
                  <p>It is evident from theſe Scriptures which I have produced, that it is our duty to teach Gods word unto our Children; and not only to our Children, but alſo to our Servants: yea, that there are many clear, expreſs, and ſtrict Commandments given to us by the great God for our performance of this Duty. Now how ſhall we be able to appear before God at the day of Judgment, if we live in the neglect of a known Duty, which is ſo often and ſo earneſtly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon us by God himſelf!</p>

Children before they are inſtructed have no knowledge of the things of God, Deut. 31.13. <hi>And that their Children which have not known any thing:</hi> And not Children only, but the greater part of ſuch as are grown to mans eſtate have little or no knowledge of God, Pſal. 14.2. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the Children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God.</hi> And what account doth he give of the Children of men? Rom. 3.11. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God.</hi> There is none comparatively, there are ſo few underſtanding men, that they ſeem to be none, compared with the multitude of ignorant perſons; or if it relate to men in an unregenerate condition, they are all deſtitute of the true and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt. Even in thoſe places, in thoſe families, and in thoſe Churches where perſons injoy great means of knowledge, if inquiry be made what underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the things of God ſuch perſons have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, there will be found much ignorance in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have a long time injoyed great advantages to get knowledge. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means of knowledge than any Nation under Heaven, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his judgments unto</hi> Iſrael,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102523:18"/>
                     <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any nation;</hi> yet hear how God complains of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ignorance. <hi>Jer,</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people is fooliſh, they have not known me, they are fooliſh children, and they have none underſtanding, they are wiſe to do evill, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> The Hebrews who had excellent teaching a long time, in ſo much that in reſpect of the time and means they might have been Teachers of others, were ſo raw and weak in knowledge, that it was needful for them to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the firſt principles of the Oracles of <hi>God, Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> had many eminent Paſtors and Teachers, as <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. and did excel in gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>In every thing ye are inriched by him in all utterance, and in all knowledge, —ſo that ye come behind in no gift:</hi> Yet in this eminent Church there were ſome found that had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. <hi>Some have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in regard there is naturally much <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> in the minds and underſtandings of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants; it is neceſſary we ſhould labour and take great pains with them, to bring them to the knowledge of God, by inſtructing them out of Gods word; if we have any regard either to the glory of God, or to our own good, or the good of our Children and Families. For,</p>
                  <p>1. The permitting of our Families to remain without the knowledge of God, will bring down Gods Judgments upon them: for God is wont to pour out his fury upon thoſe perſons and Families that have no knowledge of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name.</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102523:19"/>of God was one ground of the Lords contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with the Land of <hi>Iſrael, Hoſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>The Lord hath a Controverſie with the Inhabitants of the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land.</hi> If where the knowledge of God is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Nation, God hath a controverſie with that Nation, may we not alſo conclude that God hath a controverſie, and will plead his controverſie with thoſe Families where there is no knowledge of God?</p>
                  <p>2. Our Children will prove great Croſſes, and bring much grief and ſorrow upon us, if we train them up in ignorance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.25. <hi>A fooliſh ſon is a grief to his father, and bitterneſs to her that bare him, Prov.</hi> 19.13. <hi>A fooliſh ſon is the calamity of his father.</hi> And as they will be a great grief to their Parents, who are nurſed up in ignorance, ſo they will walk in ſuch courſes as will pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The ſorrows of a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman ſhall come upon him, he is an unwiſe ſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If we do not inſtruct our Children and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to inſtil knowledge into them, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs perſons, and ſpend their days in vanity, and do no ſervice for God or their Generation. They will be unable to undertake and manage common and eaſie employments, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.15. <hi>The labour of the fooliſh wearieth every one of them, becauſe he knoweth not how to go to the City.</hi> What is more eaſie to find out, than the way to a City, where there is much commerce and frequent going to and fro. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are fooliſh and indiſcreet, though they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil in common and eaſie things, as eaſie as to find the way to a City, they can bring nothing to any effect: And as fooliſh children will be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to manage any employments of themſelves, ſo ſo they are unfit to be employed by others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.6.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102523:19"/>
                     <hi>He that ſendeth a meſſage by the hand of a fool, cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If our Children and Servants be not taught to know the Lord, they cannot live godly lives, but will be alienated from the life of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the blindneſs of their heart.</hi> They will be ſo far from leading godly lives, if they be brought up in ignorance of God, that they will prove vitious perſons; when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> neglected the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they became a ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider: Ah ſinful nation! A people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, Children that are corrupters; they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy One of Iſrael to anger, they are gone away backward.</hi> The Apoſtle ranketh ſuch as are <hi>without underſtanding</hi> among haters of God, and the chiefeſt of ſinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30, 31. If our Children and Servants be deſtitute of the knowledge of God, they will be eaſily drawn to the vileſt and moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins: ſuch as Idolatry, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>When ye knew not God, ye did ſervice to them which by nature are no Gods:</hi> Blaſphemy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.18. <hi>The fooliſh people have blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thy Name:</hi> Perſecution of the people of God, ſo far as to kill and deſtroy them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea the time cometh that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſervice; and theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me:</hi> Adultery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.7, 10, 21, 22, 25. <hi>I beheld among the ſimple ones, I diſcerned among the youths, a young man void of underſtanding, and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an Harlot—With much fair ſpeech ſhe cauſed him to yield,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102523:20"/>with the flattering of her lips ſhe forced him; he goeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her ſtraight-way, as an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter—till a dart ſtrike through his Liver, as a Bird haſteth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</hi> Such as have no inſtruction, or being inſtructed do not obey the counſels that are given to them, are in the ready way to run into all kind of evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>I have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that inſtructed me; I was almoſt in all evil, in the midſt of the Congregation and the Aſſembly.</hi> If we tremble at the thoughts of having our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prove Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Adulterers, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the people of God, and to run into all kind of evil, let us endeavour to prevent theſe great evils, by training them up in the knowledge and fear of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>5. If we bring up our Children in ignorance, they can have no fellowſhip with, or enjoyment of God, who is the chiefeſt Good: For, <hi>God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have no knowledge are ſaid to be in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs:</hi> And there can be no communion between Light and Darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>What Communion hath Light with Darkneſs?</hi> Now what will all the good things which we give our Children whilſt we live, or which we ſhall leave them when we die, avail them, if they have no enjoyment of God, who is the chiefeſt <hi>Good?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Without knowledge our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cannot obtain ſalvation, but muſt periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight.</hi> Job 36.12. <hi>They ſhall die without knowledge.</hi> Prov. 2.16. <hi>The man that wandereth out of the way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall remain in the Congregation of the dead:</hi> That is, he ſhall be caſt into Hell, and abide there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102523:20"/>among the Devils and damned perſons for ever. So it is expounded by <hi>R.

                  </p>
                  <p>7. Without knowledge our Children will not only be undone in the world to come, but they are likely by their folly and indiſcretion to undo themſelves and their Families in this world, either by idleneſs, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own fleſh,</hi> Prov. 24.30, 31. Or by prodigality, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.20. <hi>There is a treaſure to be deſired, and Oyl in the dwelling of the Wiſe, but the fooliſh ſpendeth it up:</hi> Or by Surety ſhip, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.18. <hi>A man void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtriketh hands, and becometh Surety in the preſence of his friend:</hi> Or by Law-ſuits, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.6. <hi>A fools lips enter into contention:</hi> Or by ſpeaking againſt perſons in Authority, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>The lips of a fool will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up himſelf,</hi> Prov. 10.14. <hi>The mouth of the fooliſh is near deſtruction.</hi> Or by ſome other raſh and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet carriages.</p>
                  <p>8. Inſtructing our Children and Servants out of the word of God, will remove their ignorance, and make them of fooliſh and ſimple to become wiſe and underſtanding perſons, and ſo conſequently will prevent all the afore-mentioned evils which will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue both to us and them, if they be trained up in ignorance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Whoſo loveth inſtruction loveth knowledge,</hi> Prov. 8.33. <hi>Hear inſtruction and be wiſe.</hi> Pſal. 19 7. <hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple.</hi> Prov. 1.1, 4. <hi>The Proverbs of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon—to give ſubtilty to the ſimple, and to the young

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> THere is not only much blindneſs and ignorance in the minds of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants, but they have alſo very ſinful and corrupt hearts. That we may ſee and underſtand what ſin and corruption is bound up in the hearts of our children and ſervants, let us conſider what the Scripture ſaith of the hearts of the ſons of men. The heart of man by nature is void and deſtitute of all good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing:</hi> and full of evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil.</hi>— Yea, the ſeeds of the fouleſt ſins, ſuch as Murder, Adultery, Blaſphemy, and the like, are in the heart of man, which will break out if they be left to themſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſs, blaſphemies.</hi> The inclinations of the heart to ſin, even to the worſt of ſins, are ſtrong and violent; ſo that the heart is not only ſet upon evil, but fully ſet to do evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> There is ſuch a bottomleſs depth of ſin in their hearts, that we cannot fathom it, it is hard to expreſs, yea, hard to underſtand how wicked and ſinful the heart of man is: <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And this corruption of the heart, begins to work and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102523:21"/>diſcover it ſelf very early, even whilſt we are young, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth:</hi> Iſai. 48.8. <hi>I knew that thou wouldeſt deal very treacherouſly, and waſt called a tranſgreſſour from the womb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing there is ſo much ſin and corruption in the hearts of our children and ſervants, from hence it will follow, that it is our duty to train them up in the knowledge and obedience of the Word of God, whereby their hearts may be purified and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; and that it is neceſſary that we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the skill and ſtrength that we have in this work: for,</p>
                  <p>1. Though their hearts be exceeding ſinful, as we have heard before; yet if we inſtruct them in the knowledge, and train them up in the obedience of the Word of God, this will be a means to purifie and ſanctifie their hearts, and to reform their lives: for the word of God hath a ſanctifying vertue in it, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth, thy Word is Truth:</hi> And being hid in the heart, it will cleanſe the heart, and keep a man from ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean through the word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> Pſal. 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Obeying and practiſing the word, will puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ye have purified your Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit.</hi>— If we can bring our Children to take heed to their ways, and to frame them according to the word of God, we need not doubt but this will cleanſe their hearts and lives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? By taking heed thereto, according to thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If we ſuffer our Children and Servants to live
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102523:22"/>without inſtruction, and do not labour to bring them acquainted with God, and with his holy word, there is no hope that they ſhould be reclaimed from their ſins, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God, for the ſpirit of whoredoms is in the midſt of them, and they have not known the Lord.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet gives this reaſon why they would not frame their doings to turn to the Lord, <hi>They did not know the Lord, and the ſpirit of whoredoms was in them.</hi> By the ſpirit of whoredoms we may underſtand ſtrong and habitual inclinations to ſins of uncleanneſs, and alſo to Idolatry, which is ſpiritual Adultery. When the mind of a man is vehemently carried out after a thing, and theſe impetuous motions continue and reſide with him, the Scripture calls this by the name of a Spirit, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The Spirit of Jealouſie.</hi> From this paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> we may draw this concluſion, As long as perſons who have ſtrong and habitual inclinations to that which is evil (which is the caſe of all Children and grown perſons that are in an unregenerate condition) continue ignorant of <hi>God,</hi> there is no hope that they ſhould frame their doings to turn unto the Lord. Our Children and Servants will be ſo far from reforming their lives without inſtruction, that as long as they remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God, they will grow worſe and worſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.3. <hi>They proceed from evil to evil, and know not me ſaith the Lord.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. <hi>Evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If we ſuffer our Children and Servants to walk after their own hearts luſt, we ſhall undo them for ever; for this is the broad way that leads to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for a man to walk after the luſts of his own heart, and we ſhall alſo bring down Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon our ſelves, and cauſe his Judgments to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102523:22"/>reſt upon our Families for many Generations, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>I will judge his houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not; and therefore I have ſworn unto the houſe of Eli, That the iniquity of Eli's houſe ſhall not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. We had need employ all the skill and ſtrength that we have in teaching and educating our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the knowledge and fear of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a difficult work to change their Natures, and to ſubdue their Wills to Gods Will. <hi>Zophar</hi> compares man to a wild Aſſes Colt, <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. <hi>For vain man would be wiſe, though man be born like a wild Aſſes Colt.</hi> The difficulty of taming a wild Aſs, his untractable ranging diſpoſition, is elegantly ſet forth <hi>Job</hi> 39.7, 8. <hi>He ſcorneth the multitude of the City, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regardeth he the crying of the Driver, the range of the mountains is his paſture, and he ſearcheth after every green thing.</hi> Such a wild unruly Creature is man, and that from his Birth: <hi>Man is born like a wild Aſſes Colt.</hi> If he be not tamed whilſt he is young, he will not regard the voice of his Teachers, though multitudes labour with him one after another, it will be a difficult matter to bring him to any good order. If our Children have added to their ſinful natures, a cuſtom in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes, it will be as hard to reclaim them as to change the Leopards ſpots, or to make the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> (who is naturally black) to become white, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.25. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>

                  <p>1. Prayer is a Duty to be performed in all Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; the neglect of it is ſuch a great ſin, that God ranks thoſe Families among the Heathen that do not call upon him, and threatens to pour out his fury upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name:</hi> Fury is more than wrath or anger, it is the higheſt degree of anger; God is not only angry, but he is filled with fury againſt, and will pour out his fury upon thoſe Families that do not call upon him. Now how ſhall our Children or Servants be able to pray without inſtruction? Or how are they like to be edified by joyning in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Prayer, if they be ignorant of that God to whom we pray, and of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe name our prayers are offered up to God, and of thoſe things which are asked of <hi>God,</hi> when we pray to him in his Sons name. That knowledge is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to inable us to pray, and alſo to joyn in prayer ſo as to receive edification, (and if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then alſo inſtruction, which breedeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is evident from ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102523:23"/>10.14. <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed, and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> 1 Cor. 14, 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and will pray with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> Job 37.19. <hi>Teach us what we ſhall ſay unto him, for we can not order our ſpeech by reaſon of darkneſs.</hi> Ignorant worſhip is not accepted of God; Chriſt reproved the <hi>Samaritans</hi> for worſhipping they knew not what, and tells them, that ſuch as expect Life and Salvation from God, muſt worſhip him underſtandingly, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what, we know what we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for ſalvation is of the Jews.</hi> If they be wholly ignorant, when they are joyning in holy Duties, as in prayer, or in praiſing God, though he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Duties, performeth them well, and in a ſpiritual manner; yet ſuch as are ignorant of God, and the things of God, will not be edified by thoſe Duties, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>When thou ſhalt bleſs with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ſay, Amen; ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks in an unknown Tongue, but though we uſe a known Tongue in prayer, or praiſing God, yet if our Families have no knowledge of God, they will receive little or no edification by joyning with us, when we pray to, or praiſe the Lord. If we do not train up our Families in the fear, as well as in the knowledge of God, though they ſhould learn to pray, their prayers will avail nothing with God, <hi>John</hi> 9.31. <hi>Now we know that God heareth not Sinners; but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth. Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>And when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes; yea, when ye make
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102523:24"/>many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is the Duty of every Member of our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to praiſe the Lord, and to give him thanks for his mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.2. <hi>Let all fleſh bleſs his holy Name for ever and ever.</hi> Pſal. 150.6. <hi>Let every thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.18. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you.</hi> It is a duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.2. <hi>Every day will I bleſs thee.</hi> Pſal. 92.1, 2. <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and to ſing praiſes unto thy Name, O moſt High; to ſhew forth thy loving kindneſs in the morning, and thy faithfulneſs every night.</hi> It is a duty to be performed not only by our ſelves when we are alone, but all the members in the Family ſhould joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in bleſſing and praiſing God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.19. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O houſe of Aaron.</hi> Pſal. 34.3. <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together.</hi> Deut. 14.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce, thou and thy houſhold.</hi> Now how can our Families bleſs and praiſe <hi>God</hi> for his mercies, if they be not taught that all the good things they have, come from God; and alſo taught who that God is that gives them all good things, and how and in what manner they ſhould expreſs their thankfulneſs unto him? We find that when the Scripture ſpeaketh of praiſing God, it often intimates that we ſhould praiſe him with underſtanding: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.6, 7. <hi>Sing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes; ſing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes: For God is the King of the Earth, ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding.</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. <hi>I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo:</hi> Which implieth, that the Lord cannot be praiſed by the ſons of men in an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, if they be not endued with knowledge and underſtanding.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102523:24"/>
                  <p>3. It is our Duty to exhort our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to flee from ſin, and to follow after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to love, and fear, and ſerve the Lord, and to walk in his ways, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Now if we would have our exhortations to take place, we muſt joyn Doctrine or Inſtruction with our Exhortations. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> If we do not inſtruct them wherein the nature of thoſe Duties lieth unto which we exhort them, and how and in what manner they ſhould be performed, we ſhall be like thoſe that beat the air, our Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be of no advantage to them.</p>
                  <p>4. It is our Duty to reprove our Children and Servants when we ſee them negligent in their duty, or committing any ſin againſt God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> If we muſt rebuke a Neighbour, then much more thoſe of our own houſe, when they ſin againſt the Lord. Now inſtruction makes way for reproof; one word of reproof to a man inſtructed with wiſdom and underſtanding, will do more good than an hundred ſtripes will do towards the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ignorant fooliſh perſon: <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.10. <hi>A reproof entreth more into a wiſe man, than an hundred ſtripes into a fool.</hi> We ſhall find it a very difficult matter to faſten a reproof upon our Children and Servants, ſo as to make it take place, and do them good, if they be without underſtanding. The like may be ſaid of other Duties which we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form towards our Children and Servants, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed ſucceſsfully if we ſuffer our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to be without Inſtruction.</p>

                  <p>4. God teacheth his children and ſervants out of his holy Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law.</hi> The Lord builds up all his houſhold in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, and holineſs, upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles; that is, the Doctrine delivered in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>Ye are of the Houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi> He inſtructs penitent perſons by making known his word to them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my Reproof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. David</hi> deſcribes Gods teaching his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto Iſrael.</hi> In like manner, when we teach our children and ſervants, we ſhould teach them out of the word of God, and eſtabliſh them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, belief, and practice, of the Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scriptures by the Prophets, and Apoſtles.</p>

                     </label> IT may be ſome will here demand, Is it not the Duty of Mothers, as well as of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to teach their Children?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although the Scripture doth forbid Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men teaching in publick Aſſemblies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law:</hi> 1 Tim. 2.11, 12. <hi>Let the woman learn in ſilence with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection—But I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi> Yet it doth allow them to teach their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and though this work doth lie chiefly upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102523:27"/>to teach Gods word unto their Children, as appeareth by the ſpecial charge that is given to them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5. yet it is the duty of Mothers alſo to inſtruct and watch over their Children and Servants. For the proving hereof, and the ſtirring up of Mothers to joyn with, and to be helpful to their Husbands, in inſtructing their Children and Servants, I ſhall propoſe to them theſe following Conſiderations:</p>
                  <p>1. It hath been the practice of godly women in former times, to inſtruct their Children in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, which the holy Ghoſt hath left upon record, as a monument of their praiſe, as long as the world ſhall continue, and as a Pattern to be followed by all women that fear God. <hi>Solomons</hi> mother, though ſhe was a Queen, did not look upon it as a work beneath her, to inſtruct her Son; but taught him a Prophecy containing excellent Leſſons concerning Chaſtity and Temperance, defending the Oppreſſed, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 31.1. <hi>The words of King Lemuel, the Prophecy which his mother taught him:</hi> What this Prophecy was that his mother taught him, is ſet down in the following verſes; <hi>Solomon</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his Father, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>I was my Fathers Son— he taught me alſo;</hi> yet <hi>Solomon</hi>'s mother did not think her ſelf excuſed from teaching her Son, becauſe his Father inſtructed him, but ſhe joyn'd with her husband, and teacheth him a Prophecy. Now if thoſe women who haue godly Husbands that inſtruct their Families, muſt alſo inſtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; how much more is it the duty of thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have careleſs and negligent Husbands that regard not their Families, to be diligent in teaching their Children and Servants? Another example we have in <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice; Lois</hi> being converted to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102523:27"/>Chriſtian Religion, trains up her Daughter <hi>Eunice</hi> in the faith of Chriſt; <hi>Eunice</hi> being inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt, inſtructs her Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p>2. Children are commanded to hearken to; and not forſake the inſtruction which their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as well as which their Fathers) give them out of the Law of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. <hi>My Son hear the inſtruction of thy Father, and forſake not the Law of thy Mother;</hi> which implies, That Mothers, as well as Fathers, are to teach Gods Laws to their Children.</p>
                  <p>3. It is mentioned as one of the Vertues of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman, <hi>That ſhe looketh well to the ways of her Houſhold,</hi> Prov. 31.27. and this overſight that ſhe takes of the ways of her Houſhhold, conduceth ſo much to the good of her Children, that it will cauſe them to bleſs God for her as long as they live, as the next verſe implieth, <hi>Her Children ariſe up, and call her bleſſed,</hi> verſ. 28. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth elder women to be <hi>Teachers of good things,</hi> Tit. 2.3. And he tells them both whom they ſhould teach, <hi>younger women,</hi> and what Leſſons they ſhould teach young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er women, verſ. 4.5. which is to be underſtood of inſtilling thoſe Principles into their Children and Maid Servants, how they ſhould demean themſelves when God ſhall bring them into a married eſtate, and alſo of inſtructing their Neighbours and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance when they viſit them, and have occaſion to confer with them.</p>
                  <p>4. The Mother as well as the Father doth concur to the conveying of a ſinful nature unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>In ſin did my Mother conceive me:</hi> And therefore Mothers ought by their prayers, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102523:28"/>tears, and inſtructions, and the uſe of all good means, to endeavour after the Converſion and Regeneration of their Children, as well as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>5. Children are very apt to follow their Mothers example, in ſo much that it's become a Proverb, <hi>As is the Mother, ſo is the Daughter;</hi> and the truth of this Proverb is ſuch, that God himſelf alloweth of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.44. <hi>Behold every one that uſeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs ſhall uſe this Proverb againſt thee, As is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo is the Daughter.</hi> So that if Mothers live religiouſly, and ſhew a good example to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and inſtruct them out of Gods word, there is great hope that their Children will become Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alſo. It is remarkable both amongſt the good and evil Kings that were in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the Scripture doth frequently record their Mothers names; as for good Kings, we may ſee 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.42, 43. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.2, 3. and 22.12. And for evil Kings, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.26, 27. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.2, 3. which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Mothers example and carriage amongſt her Children, hath a great influence upon them, to make them either good or evil.</p>
                  <p>6. Mothers have greater opportunities to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling good things into their Children, than their Fathers, for they are oftener with them, eſpecially whilſt they are young, as they are dreſſing or undreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, or giving them meat, or ſitting with them at work, or walking abroad with them, they ſhould be talking with them of the word of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. And every one is to do good according to the opportunities that God puts into their hands, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                  <p>7. Hereby Mothers may do great ſervice for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102523:28"/>Chriſt, in training up Children for the Lord: All the good that ſuch Children ſhall do in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhall redound to the Mothers Comfort and Reward. The Apoſtle mentioneth the bringing up of Children (by which is meant bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord) amongſt the firſt and chiefeſt good works which women are able to do in their generation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of for good works, if ſhe have brought up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>8. What ſervice women do for Chriſt, he takes as kindly as he doth what men do for him, when there was a woman poured upon his head a Box of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oyntment, though the Diſciples had indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the Lord Jeſus took it well from her, and ſaid that this act of the woman ſhould be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and be ſpoken of to her praiſe, as long as the Goſpel ſhould be preached in the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole world, there alſo this that this woman hath done, ſhall be told for a memorial of her.</hi> If you that are Mothers teach Gods word to your Children, and labour to bring them up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of God, the Lord Jeſus will take this more kindly from you, than he took this box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Oyntment from this woman, which anointed his body againſt his burial: And that may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced ſeveral ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. Chriſt was more pleaſed with thoſe that mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his word, than with thoſe that were at the coſt and trouble to provide for his Body; as appears from the caſe of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha, Mary ſat at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus feet, and heard his word, but Martha was cumbred with much ſerving,</hi> Luk. 10.38, 39. Hereupon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102523:29"/>complains to Chriſt, that her ſiſter had left her to ſerve alone, and deſires him to bid <hi>Mary</hi> to help her; but Chriſt commends <hi>Mary</hi>'s choice, and her work, who was employed about his word, above <hi>Martha</hi>'s, who was employed in preparing food for his Body, and thoſe that were with him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 40, 41, 42.</item>
                        <item>2. The Lord Jeſus loves your Childrens Souls as well as he loves his own Body; he gave his own Body to be crucified to ſave your Childrens Souls; And therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is as acceptable to ſee you endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave your Childrens Souls, by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and teaching them out of his holy Word, as it was to have his Body anointed with pretious Ointment.</item>
                        <item>3. The Name of God and Chriſt is like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ointment, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Thy Name is as Ointment poured forth:</hi> — Yea it is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than any Ointment in the World.

Though they be ſuch as walk in ſinful and deſtructive courſes, by teaching and inſtructing them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they may be converted from their ſins unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>I will teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and Sinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi> We read of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that both he himſelf and all his houſe were ſaved by the word wherewith they were inſtructed by <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Who ſhall tell thee words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou and all thy houſe ſhall be ſaved.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if Governours of Families did carefully inſtruct their Families out of the word of God, they might in ſo doing both ſave themſelves and all their houſe: With what diligence, with what ſpeed, with what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity, with what a reſolved minde to perſevere therein under all diſcouragements, ſhould you ſet upon this work, ſeeing there is hope that hereby you may ſave your Children and your Servants Souls? That this argument may have the greater force to perſwade and prevail with you to ſet your hearts to this work; Conſider,</p>
                  <p>1. What great worth and excellency there is in an immortal Soul: The Soul of the pooreſt Child or Servant in your Families, is more worth than all the ſubſtance in your houſes, than all the Riches you have gotten or can get as long as you live; yea, than the whole world, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> And therefore you ſhould ſpend more thoughts and pains about ſaving your Children and Servants Souls, than you would do to gain the whole world, if there were a probability that by your care and induſtry you might get into your poſſeſſion all the good things that are in the world. There is ſuch an excellency in the Soul, that when any one
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102523:31"/>ſinner is brought to repentance, whereby his Soul is put into a ſtate of Salvation, all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven rejoyce at this glad Tidings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. <hi>There is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. By converting your Children and Servants, you ſhall recover their ſouls from the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: Before their converſion he rules and carries them captive to this and the other ſin, as he pleaſeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. But when they are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are freed and delivered from the power of Satan. The Converſion of a ſinner is the opening <hi>of his eyes, and turning him from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Act. 26.18. It is Gods delivering of a ſinner from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſlating him into the Kingdom of his dear Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. If your Children were under Turkiſh Slavery, would you ſpare any pains or coſt to redeem them from the hands of the Turks? It is far worſe to have them under the power of Satan, than under the power of the Turks. Suppoſe the Devil had gotten poſſeſſion of your Childrens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſhould torture them, as he did the woman of <hi>Canaan's</hi> Daughter, who cried out to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil;</hi> or ſhould rend and tear them, as he did that young man whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made his moan to Chriſt after this manner, <hi>My Son hath a dumb Spirit, and whereſoever he taketh him he teareth him, and he fometh and gnaſheth with his teeth, and he pineth away,—and oft times it hath caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, and into the waters to deſtroy him,</hi> Mark 19.17, 18, 22. would not this cauſe you to mourn, and faſt, and pray, and to uſe all means poſſible to get your Childrens Bodies delivered from the tyranny
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102523:31"/>of Satan? And would you not be reſtleſs until you had obtained their deliverance? To have your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Souls under the power of the Devil, and to have them drawn ſometimes into one foul ſin, and then into another, is far worſe and more dangerous then to have their Bodies at his command; and yet this is their caſe, as long as they remain unconverted their Souls are under the power of ſin and Satan. How ſhould this cauſe you to ſtrive with God in prayer night and day, and labour with your utmoſt diligence in the uſe of all means to get their Souls converted to God?</p>
                  <p>3. By converting your Children and Servants, you ſhall prevent their dying in their ſins, and ſave them from the wrath of God, and the torments of Hell, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know that he which converteth the ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins:</hi> What a great, what a good work is this, <hi>to ſave a ſoul from death?</hi> Shall we think any pains too much to ſave immortal Souls from eternal Death? If you ſaw any of your Children ready to fall into a fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, which would conſume them to Aſhes in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you would ſuddenly lay hold on them, and prevent, if it were poſſible, their falling into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of fire: Hell is called <hi>A Furnace of Fire,</hi> Mat. 13.42. As long as your Children live in ignorance, and in an unconverted condition, they are in danger every day to fall into this furnace of fire. And doth it not concern you then, to prevent with all poſſible ſpeed their falling into everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>
                  <p>4. Conſider what great pains Jeſus Chriſt took to ſave and convert Souls: The great end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102523:32"/>into the world and taking our Nature upon him, was to ſave Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt:</hi> When he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth he was ſo diligent in teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the people, that he did not omit his work one day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.47. <hi>He taught daily in the Temple:</hi> He was ſo diligent to teach and inſtruct the people, that he could not find ſpare time to eat his Bread, which canſed ſome of his friends to think and ſay he was beſide himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.20. He was not only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent in preaching, but was content to lay down his life to ſave our ſouls. Shall not this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt provoke you to give all diligence to ſave both your own, and the ſouls of all that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Charge?</p>
                  <p>5. God will give a greater degree of Glory to thoſe that are inſtrumental to convert and ſave ſouls, than to other Saints: For whereas they ſhall ſhine only as the Firmament, they that convert others ſhall ſhine as the Stars in the Firmament, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. You cannot approve your ſelves to be Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons either to God or Men, if you do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what becomes of your childrens and ſervants ſouls; <hi>A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt, Prov.</hi> 12.10. If this be true, how can they account themſelves righteous perſons who have no regard what becomes of the ſouls of their Children? If a Beaſt go aſtray, though it be not our own but our Neighbours, yea our Enemies, we muſt by no means neglect to bring it back, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4. <hi>If thou meet thine Enemies Ox or his Aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again.</hi> If we are bound ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102523:32"/>ſtraightly to bring back an Ox or an Aſs of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when he goes aſtray, then what obligations lie upon us to bring home to God our own Children, and our houſhold Servants, when we ſee them going aſtray from the Lord?</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102523:33"/>of Families are in the nature and condition of Watchmen, as well as thoſe that bear Rule in the Church, and muſt give an account for thoſe ſouls that are committed to their charge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give an account.</hi> And as for thoſe that are placed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Watchmen, if any perſons over whom God hath made them Watchmen be loſt through their neglect to inſtruct them in their duty, or to reclaim them from their ſins, the Blood of thoſe that periſh ſhall be required at the Watchmans hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto the Houſe of Iſrael, therefore hear the word at my Mouth, and give them warning from Me, when I ſay to the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to ſave his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand:</hi> What Inditement is brought in againſt the Jews? <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34. <hi>In thy Skirts is found the Blood of the Souls of the poor Innocents— I have not found it by ſecret ſearch, but upon all theſe.</hi> The like may be ſaid of many Maſters of Families, <hi>In their Skirts will be found the Blood of the Souls of their Children and Servants: In their Skirts</hi>—That is, it will plainly and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear unto all men at the day of Judgment, that they are guilty of the Blood of the Souls of their Children and Servants, for want of inſtructing and training them up in the fear of God: VVe cannot poſſibly be clear from the blood of thoſe that are committed to our charge, if either through wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or through ſloth and negligence, we forbear to inſtruct them in thoſe things that are neceſſary to their Salvation; but if we do our duty, and they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102523:33"/>in their ſins, their Blood ſhall be upon their own head, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.26, 27. <hi>I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Counſel of God:</hi> Did Parents and Maſters of Families ſeriouſly conſider what it is to have their Children and Servants die eternally, and that through their neglecting to teach and train them up in the fear of God, did they alſo conſider what it is to have the blood of Souls laid to their charge, it would ſtir them up to be diligent in inſtructing their Families, unleſs they be ſuch as have loſt all regard to their own and their Families welfare.</p>
                  <p>To preſs home this conſideration with the greater efficacy, I ſhall ſuggeſt to you three or four things more under this head. As,</p>
                  <p>1. The death of a Child goes near a Parents heart. <hi>Hagar</hi> could not endure to ſee her Child die, and therefore when ſhe thought he would die, ſhe gets a great way off from him, and ſat down and wept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.16. <hi>She ſaid, Let me not ſee the death of the Child; and ſhe ſat over againſt him, and lift up her voice and wept.</hi> VVhen tydings came to <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s death, he was exceedingly troubled at it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>And the King was much moved, and went up to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ever the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he ſaid, O my Son Abſolom, my Son, my Son Abſolom; would God I had died for thee, O Abſolom, my Son, my Son!</hi> VVhen <hi>Jacob</hi> did but ſuppoſe that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, though he had eleven Sons living, his ſorrow was ſo great, that he refuſed to be comforted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.34, 35. <hi>Jacob rent his cloaths, and put ſackcloth upon his loyns, and mourned for his Son many days; and all his Sons, and all his Daughters roſe up to comfort him, but he refuſed to be comforted; and he ſaid, For I will go down
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102523:34"/>into the Grave unto my Son mourning: Thus his Father wept for him.</hi> If it be ſo grievous to Parents to ſee their Children deprived of their natural life, how ſhould it pierce their hearts to have them deprived of eternal Life? If they are ſo grieved at the death of their Bodies, how ſhould they lay to heart the death of their Souls? How ſhould it wound them to have their Children caſt into the lake that burneth with fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death; where they ſhall be always burning, and yet never be conſumed; they ſhall be always dying, and yet never be dead? yea, how ſhould it affect them when they conſider that they themſelves have through their negligence been the cauſe of their Childrens dying the ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>2. It would pierce a flinty heart to ſee Children dying in their Parents Arms for want of Bread. VVhen <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaw little Children in the time of Famine, ſome dying in the ſtreets, others breathing out their ſouls in their Mothers Boſoms for want of Bread to ſuſtain their Lives, it made him weep till his eyes and his heart failed him with grief, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my Liver is poured upon the earth, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Daughter of my People, becauſe the Children and the Sucklings ſwoon in the ſtreets of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they ſay to their Mothers, Where is Corn and Wine? When they ſwooned as the wounded in the Streets of the City, when their Soul was poured out into their Mothers Boſom.</hi> This is a ſorrowful ſight, but it is far more dreadful to ſee Children periſhing to all eternity in their Parents Houſes, for want of their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the Bread of Life, than to ſee them die by Famine.</p>
                  <p>3. It is an unſpeakable loſs for a man to loſe one
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102523:34"/>Soul: Though he do not loſe his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Souls, though he loſe not one Soul beſides his own, the gain of the whole world will not make up this loſs; as appears from the fore-quoted Scripture <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.36. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> If it be ſuch a great loſs for a man to loſe his own Soul, what will it be for a man, beſides the loſs of his own, to be charged with the loſs of the Souls of his Children, and of all that ever were committed to his charge.</p>
                  <p>4. Blood is a crying ſin, the cry of it reacheth to the Heavens, and calls to God for vengeance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10. <hi>What haſt thou done? The voyce of thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Blood crieth unto me from the ground:</hi> And bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great curſe on thoſe that are guilty of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, Verſ. 11. <hi>And now art thou curſed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Blood from thy hand.</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>A fugitive and vagabond ſhalt thou be upon the earth.</hi> Although all Blood crieth loud, yet none crieth like the Blood of Souls. As much as the Soul ſurpaſſeth the Body in excellency, ſo much greater is their ſin who are acceſſary to the deſtroying of Souls, than theirs who only take away the life of the Body. It is ſpoken of as a dreadful Judgment to have the Stones and Timber of a Mans Houſe crying out againſt him, (which will be the lot of thoſe that get or build Houſes by unrighteous means) <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Stone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the Timber ſhall anſwer it.</hi> The man that is in this caſe can have but little joy in his Houſe, either by night or by day. But what is this to the cry of ſuch Souls as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh byour means, who will be crying out againſt us to all eternity? What <hi>Zipporah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by reaſon of the Circumciſion, <hi>Surely a bloody Husband
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102523:35"/>art thou to me,</hi> Exod. 4.25, 26. The like will many women ſay to their Husbands, who periſh for want of their inſtructing them, Surely a bloody Husband haſt thou been unto me; and Children will cry out againſt their Fathers, for ſuffering them to die and be damned for want of inſtruction, Surely a bloody Father haſt thou been unto me; and Servants will cry out againſt their Maſters, Surely a bloody Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter haſt thou been unto me. To undo a man in his Eſtate by oppreſſion, or violent taking away his Goods, is a mighty ſin, there are dreadful things threatned againſt ſuch as are guilty of this ſin, <hi>Job</hi> 20.19. to 29. <hi>Becauſe he hath oppreſſed and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the poor, becauſe he hath violently taken away an houſe which he built not; ſurely he ſhall not feel quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his belly, he ſhall not ſave of that which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, there ſhall none of his meat be left, therefore ſhall no man look for his goods; in the fulneſs of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraits; every hand of the wicked ſhall come upon him: When he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain it upon him while he is eating: He ſhall flee from the iron weapon, and the Bow of ſteel ſhall ſtrike him through; it is drawn and cometh out of the Body, yea the gliſtering Sword cometh out of his Gall; terrours are upon him, all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be hid in his ſecret place, a fire not blown ſhall conſume him. It ſhall go ill with him that is left in his Tabernacle, the Heavens ſhall reveal his iniquity, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him: the increaſe of his houſe ſhall depart, and his goods ſhall flow away in the day of his wrath.</hi> To undo a man body and Soul to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the world to come, is a far greater ſin, than to undo a man in his eſtate in this world: And if ſuch dreadful things are denounced againſt the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, what ſhall be done to the Soul-murderer?</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102523:35"/>
                  <p>5. He that neglecteth or refuſeth to inſtruct his Family, is as certainly guilty of the Blood of their Souls, as he that ſuffereth his Family to ſtarve by neglecting or refuſing to give them that food which ſhould preſerve their Lives, is guilty of deſtroying their natural Life: for as ſurely as the Body will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without its food, ſo ſurely will the Soul periſh without inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.23. <hi>He ſhall die without inſtruction.</hi> Prov. 29.28. <hi>Where there is no viſion the people periſh.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102523:36"/>and underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, which ſhall hear all theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding People.</hi> By being acquainted with the word, they ſhall attain to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Civil Things, and Divine; in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and to Men: <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. <hi>My Son, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo ſhalt thou find favour and good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſight of God and Man.</hi> Yea, by inſtructing our Families in the knowledge of the Scriptures, we ſhall convey to them the beſt wiſdom that is attained by the ſons of men, and that is, to be wiſe to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that inſtructing of our Families out of the Scriptures, will be a means of enduing our children and ſervants with wiſdom and underſtanding, this may be of great force to ſtir us up to diligence in teaching them Gods holy word, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many, and what great advantages come to our children and ſervants by being furniſhed with VViſdom and Underſtanding. I will mention a few.</p>
                  <p>1. To leave our Children endued wiſdom, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to leave them great Riches: <hi>For Wiſdom is better than Rubies, and all the things that may be deſired are not to be compared to it,</hi> Prov. 8.11. <hi>How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it to get wiſdom than Gold, and to get underſtanding, rather to be choſen than Silver,</hi> Prov. 16.16. VViſdom is a greater Ornament and a more lovely Jewel than a multitude of Rubies and pretious Stones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.15. <hi>There is Gold and a multitude of Rubies, but the Lips of Knowledge are a pretious Jewel.</hi> VViſdom is of that excellency that it far ſurpaſſeth all the Silver
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102523:36"/>and Gold, and pretious Stones in the world: <hi>Job</hi> 28.16, 17, 18. <hi>It cannot be valued with the Gold of Ophir, with the precious Onyx, or the Saphir, the Gold and the Cryſtal cannot equal it, and the exchange of it ſhall not be for Jewels of fine Gold; no mention ſhall be made of Coral, or of Pearls: for the price of Wiſdom is above Rubies.</hi> How deſirous are moſt Parents to leave their Children great Eſtates? If Wiſdom be better than all the Riches of the world, why ſhould we not deſire and labour more to leave them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with VViſdom, than to leave them great Riches?</p>
                  <p>2. If we leave them endued with VViſdom, though they be poor, we leave them better than if we left them Kings and Princes deſtitute of VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Better is a poor and a wiſe Child, than an old and fooliſh King:</hi> Many perſons who have aſpiring minds, would ſpare no pains to make their Children Kings and Princes, if they ſaw any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to effect it; why then ſhould we be backward to convey that to our Children which will be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage to them, than the promoting of them to be Kings.</p>
                  <p>3. Wiſdom will make our Children of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit: <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.27. <hi>A man of underſtanding is of an excellent Spirit.</hi> An excellent Spirit is a great Ornament to a man, and to be preferred above No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Birth, Beauty, Riches, or any external Accompliſhments. <hi>Darius</hi> finding in <hi>Daniel</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit, preferred him above all the Princes and Nobles in his Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3. <hi>This Daniel was preferred above the Preſidents and Princes, becauſe an excellent Spirit was in him, and the King thought to ſet him over the whole Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Wiſdom and Underſtanding will make the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102523:37"/>Members of our Family uſeful in their Generation, in whatſoever places and ſtations they ſhall be fixed by the Providence of God. What bleſſing was prayed for on <hi>Boaz</hi> his behalf by his Friends, <hi>Do thou worthily in Ephratah,</hi> Ruth 4.11. The ſame ſhall fall upon our Children, if we train them up in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God. They ſhall do worthily in the places where God caſts their lot, although their lot be caſt in evil times and ſinful places, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.32. <hi>Such as do wickedly againſt the Covenant ſhall be corrupt by Flatteries; but the people that do know their God, ſhall be ſtrong and do exploits.</hi> By being endued with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Underſtanding, they will prove great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the Families, Cities, and Kingdoms, in which they live. They will be bleſſings to the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Families where they live, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Through wiſdom is an houſe builded, and by underſtanding it is eſtabliſhed.</hi> Yea, they will be Bleſſings to the Towns and Cities wherein they live, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.14, 15. <hi>There was a little City, and a few men within it; and there came a great King againſt it, and beſieged it, and built great Bulwarks againſt it; now there was found in it a poor wiſe man, and he by his wiſdom delivered the City.</hi> By the means of a wiſe Woman the City of <hi>Abel</hi> was preſerved from deſtruction; When <hi>Joab</hi> was come againſt it with a great Army, to deſtroy the place, ſhe by her wiſe carriage both mollified <hi>Joabs</hi> Spirit, and brought over the men of the City to comply with his deſire, and ſo ſaved the City from ruine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.15, 16, 22. Yea, more than this, they will be Bleſſings to the States and Kingdoms in which they live; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a Land many are the Princes thereof; but by a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge the ſtate thereof ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. Joſeph</hi> being a wiſe and diſcreet man, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102523:37"/>41.39. was a great bleſſing to all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not to <hi>Egypt</hi> only, but to all the Countreys round about, who were ſuſtained by the Proviſion, that he had laid up againſt the time of that great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>5. Wiſdom will cauſe our Children to live in good repute and credit all their days: <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.35. <hi>The wiſe ſhall inherit Glory, but ſhame ſhall be the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fools.</hi> Eccl. 8.1. <hi>A mans wiſdom maketh his face to ſhine</hi>—It will procure them favour and honour and reſpect from all ſorts of perſons, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee, ſhe ſhall bring thee to honour when thou doſt embrace her; ſhe ſhall give to thine head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee:</hi> Prov. 14.35. <hi>The Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is towards a wiſe Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Wiſdom will keep our Children from imbezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, and miſ-ſpending their Eſtates which we leave them, and will help them to preſerve, increaſe and uſe well that portion of Goods or Lands, that we ſhall bequeath to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.4. <hi>By knowledge ſhall the Chambers be filled with all the precious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Riches,</hi> Prov. 21.20. <hi>There is a treaſure to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and Oyl in the dwelling of the wiſe, but a fooliſh man ſpendeth it up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Wiſdom will keep them from falling into thoſe troubles and ſnares wherewith fooliſh and indiſcreet perſons are intangled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>A prudent man fore-ſeeth the evil and hideth himſelf, but the ſimple paſs on and are puniſhed.</hi> And when they do fall into trouble, knowledge will help them to get out of their troubles, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Through knowledge ſhall the Juſt be delivered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Wiſdom will preſerve them from keeping evil company, that they ſhall not be intangled with the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102523:38"/>acquaintance either of lewd men or laſcivious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are the bane and deſtruction of many young men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 16. <hi>When wiſdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleaſant to thy Soul, Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding ſhall keep thee, to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that ſpeaketh froward things,—to deliver thee from the ſtrange Woman, even from the ſtranger which flattereth with her words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Wiſdom will make our Children prove great Comforts to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.1. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father:</hi> Prov. 23.15, 16. <hi>My Son, if thine heart be wiſe, my heart ſhall rejoyce, even mine; yea, my reins ſhall rejoyce when thy lips ſpeak right things:</hi> And verſ. 24, 25. <hi>The Father of the Righteous ſhall greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and he that begetteth a wiſe Child ſhall have joy of him; thy Father and thy Mother ſhall be glad, and ſhe that bare thee ſhall rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Wiſdom and Underſtanding are means of leading them to life and ſalvation: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.22. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is a well-ſpring of life unto him that hath it.</hi> Prov. 3.21, 22. <hi>Keep ſound Wiſdom and Diſcretion, ſo ſhall they be Life and Grace to thy Neck:</hi> John 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Do we not thirſt after the ſalvation of our Childrens Souls? If we do, then let us be diligent to inſtruct them in the Striptures, which will make them wiſe to ſalvation.</p>

That this is the way to furniſh them with wiſdom, and what Advantages will come to them by being endued with Wiſdom, hath been ſhewed already. There are many other great Benefits and Advantages will accrue to our Children, by being inſtructed in the Scriptures: I will inſtance in ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>1. Acquaintance with the Word of God will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with grounds of Conſolation, whereby they may be able to bear up chearfully, and comfort themſelves under all the troubles of this preſent life. We know not what troubles our Children may meet with, when we are at Reſt in our Graves; we leave them in a troubleſome world, where they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with variety of afflictions, <hi>Job</hi> 14.1. <hi>Man that is born of a Woman is of few Days, and full of trouble;</hi> eſpecially if they walk in the path that leads to life, for there is no getting to Heaven, but through much tribulation: <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>We muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And if our Children have not ſomewhat out of Gods Word to comfort themſelves withall under their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, they will ſink under their ſorrows, and be in danger to make away themſelves: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.92. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delight, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> But if they be acquainted with the word of God, they may from thence be furniſhed with grounds of Conſolation under the greateſt troubles that can come upon them in this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102523:39"/>world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Thy words were found and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy and the rejoycing of mine heart.</hi>— It was a time of great trouble with the Prophet, and he was alone, and had none to comfort him, as we may ſee Verſ. 10, 17, 18. yet even then when he was a man of contention to the whole earth, and ſat alone, being filled with indignation, and looked upon his pain as perpetual, and his wound as incurable, Gods word was the joy and rejoycing of his heart. So <hi>David</hi> when his heart was ready to break with grief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.28. <hi>My Soul melteth for heavineſs</hi>—found joy and comfort in Gods word, Verſ. 49.50. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy Servant, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which thou haſt cauſed me to hope. This is my comfort in mine affliction.</hi>— And Verſ. 143, 162. <hi>Trouble and anguiſh have taken hold of me, yet thy Commandments are my delight; I rejoyce at thy word, as one that findeth great ſpoyl.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Acquaintance with the word of God will keep our Children from taking evil and deſtructive cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from going in thoſe paths that will bring them to deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Concerning the works of men by the words of thy Lips I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyers.</hi> The word of God laid up in their hearts, will keep them from aſſociating themſelves with evil men and evil women; It will ſo over-awe their hearts, that they will not only not run of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into evil Company, but alſo ſhun and avoid them though they uſe many flattering ſpeeches to entice them to that which is evil: <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.15. <hi>My Son, keep my words, and lay up my Commandments with thee; That they may keep thee from the ſtrange woman, from the ſtranger which flattereth with her words:</hi> See alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23, 24.</p>
                  <p>3. The knowledge of Godsword will keep them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102523:39"/>from falling into Errors, which perſons of weak Judgments and not well grounded in the Scriptures, are eaſily drawn into. Errors ariſe from ignorance of the Scriptures: <hi>Mark</hi> 12.24. <hi>Do ye not therefore err, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God.</hi> Growing in knowledge is preſcribed by the Apoſtle as a means to prevent perſons being led into errors, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. We had need be careful to preſerve our Children from Errors, eſpecially in Fundamental Points of Religion, as well as from groſs ſins: For, 1. Except they abide in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, they can have no enjoyment of God, 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> 2. Hereſies are manifeſt works of the fleſh, as well as Adultery, and Murder, and ſuch-like ſins, and will as certainly exclude men from the Kingdom of Heaven, as the groſſeſt ſins; as we may ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>4. If we inſtruct our Children in the knowledge of Gods word, that will guide and direct them how to carry on all their undertakings, and how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the great Turns and Changes of their Lives, and all their other affairs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a Light unto my path.</hi> And the Lord hath promiſed to ſuch as converſe much with his word, and treaſure it up in their hearts, that his word ſhall lead and guide them in all their ways, and they ſhall have ſuch plain direction from his word, how to order their Affairs, as if they heard one talking with them, and ſaying this is the way, walk therein: <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.21, 22, 23. <hi>Bind them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon thine heart—When thou goeſt, it ſhall lead thee; when thou ſleepeſt, it ſhall keep thee; when thou wakeſt, it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102523:40"/>ſhall talk with thee: For the Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light, and Reproofs of Inſtruction are the way of life:</hi> Iſa. 30.21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It will help our Children even whilſt they are young, to reform their lives. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall a young man cleanſe his way, by taking heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to according to thy word.</hi> It will keep them from ſinning againſt God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> It will cauſe them to do thoſe things which are right in the ſight of God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.2. <hi>And Jehoaſh did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all his days, wherein Jehoiada the Prieſt inſtructed him.</hi> Now who is there that feareth the Lord, that would not moſt gladly have his Children reform their lives, and be kept from ſinning againſt God, and do that which is right in the ſight of the Lord?</p>
                  <p>6. By leaving our Children inſtructed in Gods word, we ſhall leave them better than if we were able to leave them thouſands of pounds of Silver and Gold: <hi>For the Law of thy mouth is better unto me than thouſands of Gold and Silver,</hi> Pſal. 119.72.</p>
                  <p>7. Godly Parents may have all that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire on the behalf of their Children, if they do train them up in the knowledge and obedience of the Scriptures. Do we deſire that our Children ſhould be brought to know and fear the Lord? This may be effected by cauſing them to treaſure up Gods word in their hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1, 5. <hi>My Son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my Commandments with thee—Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> Would we have our
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102523:40"/>Children continue in the ways of God, walking with and ſerving God as long as they live? By inſtructing them whilſt they are young, we ſhall obtain our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in this thing: <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it.</hi> Would we have our Children inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted how to lead a godly and righteous Life? And would we have them throughly furniſhed with abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for every good work? This may be done by acquainting them with the Scriptures: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> Do we deſire our Children ſhould be proſperous men, both whilſt we live, and after we are dead, and gone into another world? This may be obtained by train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up in the knowledge and obedience of Gods word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> Do we deſire that our Children may be bleſſed with all manner of bleſſings whilſt they live here in this world, and do we deſire to have their Souls ſaved when they die? The way to obtain this, is to train them up in a godly ſort, that they may know and walk in the ways of the Lord, which he hath preſcribed to us and to them in his holy word: For 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:</hi> Prov. 10.17. <hi>He is in the way of life that keepeth inſtruction.</hi> See alſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. from verſ. 1. to 24.</p>

Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing: Verily I ſay unto you, That he ſhall make him Ruler over all his Goods.</hi> If we teach our Families the Commandments of God, and do alſo keep them our ſelves, we ſhall be great Perſons in the Kingdom of Heaven, how mean and low ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our condition be in this world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Our Children and Servants will be great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Bleſſings to us if we train them up in the fear of God. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> before his Converſion was a great croſs to his Maſter, but after he was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and God had wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, who was a more dutiful Servant than <hi>One ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? Philem.</hi> 11. <hi>Which in time paſt was to thee unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but now profitable to me and to thee.</hi> They will be great Comforts to us in this world: <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.1. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father:</hi> Prov. 29.17. <hi>Correct thy Son, and he ſhall give thee reſt; yea, he ſhall give delight unto thy Soul.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee, Syriack, Arabick,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102523:42"/>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> tranſlate the word <hi>Erudi filium tuum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Inſtruct thy Son;</hi> and the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies to inſtruct—as well as to correct, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be inſtructed ye Judges of the Earth.</hi> So that the words may be as well rendred, <hi>Inſtruct thy Son, and he ſhall give thee reſt; yea, he ſhall give delight to thy Soul.</hi> What greater Comfort can a Parent have, than to ſee his Children walking in the ways of God? 3 <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>I have no greater joy than to hear that my Children walk in truth.</hi> They will alſo be a Comfort to us in the world to come: What a Joy will it be to a godly Parent to preſent himſelf and his Children before the Lord, and to ſay, <hi>Lord, here am I, and the Children whom thou haſt given me.</hi> As it is with Miniſters of the Word, they ſhall have great joy in thoſe they have inſtructed and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing? Are not even ye, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? For ye are our Glory and Joy.</hi> So it will be with Parents and Maſters of Families, they ſhall have great Joy at the day of Judgment in thoſe whom they have taught and brought home to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>4. It will keep the memory and ſavour of Gods word upon our hearts, and breed in us a ſpiritual frame of heart, to be often teaching Gods word to our <hi>Families,</hi> Deut. 4.9, 10. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things that thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thine heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy Sons, and thy Sons Sons; eſpecially the day that thou ſtoodeſt before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord ſaid unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they (hall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102523:42"/>
                  <p>5. It will be a great ſupport and ſatisfaction to Governours of Families, in a dying hour, if their Conſciences bear them witneſs that they have been careful to train up thoſe whom the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, in the knowledge of his word. It was a comfort to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he had received the Sentence of Death, that he had done that which was good in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. Now this is a good thing in the ſight of God, to bring men to the knowledge of the Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. When the Lord Jeſus was departing out of this world, he mentions twice his giving Gods word to the men that were given to him, <hi>John</hi> 17, 8, 14. Poſſibly for this reaſon, to teach us that it will be a great comfort in a dying hour to all ſuch as have had any perſons committed to their charge, to be able to appeal to God that they have taught and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the knowledge of his holy word. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> took his leave of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and knew he ſhould ſee their faces no more, though he knew that after his departing grievous Wolves would enter in among them, not ſparing the Flock, and alſo that among themſelves ſome would ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, yet having before been diligent in teaching them the good word of God, he doth with a great deal of ſatisfaction of mind commend them to God, and to his word, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gods word was able to build them up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all oppoſitions and diſcouragements whatever, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>And now Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> In like manner, when Parents have taught their Children the word of God, although they fore-ſee that after their death their Children are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102523:43"/>likely to fall into many temptations by reaſon of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſpirits, or other evils, yet they may with much comfort commend them to God, and to the word of his grace, wherein they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                  <p>6. Such Parents as are careful to inſtruct their Families, and to train them up in the knowledge and fear of God, ſhall not only be bleſſed themſelves, but they ſhall be great bleſſing unto others, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18, 19. <hi>Abraham ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him:</hi> And why? The Reaſon is rendred in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>For I know him, that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi>

                  <p>1. They do ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Children and Servants. For ſuch as do take away the Key of Knowledge, do ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt thoſe perſons from whom they do take away the Key of Knowledge; as is evident by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees Hypocrites, for ye ſhut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven againſt men: for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in:</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:102523:43"/>with <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.52. <hi>Wo unto you Lawyers, for ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Key of Knowledge; ye entred not in your ſelves, and them that were entring in ye hindred.</hi> What a woful crime is this, for a man to ſhut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven againſt his Family?</p>
                  <p>2. Such Parents as neglect to inſtruct their children are more cruel than the Sea-monſters, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Even the Sea-monſters draw out the breſt to their young ones. The daughter of my People is become cruel as the Oſtrich in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Inſtruction is as neceſſary for the Soul, as the breſt or other food is for the Body. Yea, they are worſe than Infidels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any provide not for his own, and ſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> The providing thoſe things which concern the Souls of our Houſhold is as neceſſary, and the neglect thereof as dangerous, as the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for their Bodies. Yea, they are more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than the damned in Hell, for they are deſirous that their Relations ſhould be inſtructed, and that means ſhould be uſed to prevent their eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23, 27, 28. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and ſeeth Abraham after off, and Lazarus in his boſom—Then he ſaid, I pray thee therefore that thou wouldſt ſend him to my Fathers houſe, for I have five brethren, that he may teſtifie unto them, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. God accounts thoſe Parents haters of their Children, that neglect to inſtruct and correct them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth the Rod, hateth his Son; but he that loveth him chaſteneth him betimes.</hi> Such as do not endeavour to prevent ſin in their neighbours, do hate them in their hearts, whatever ſhew of love they make in their words, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102523:44"/>thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> If they hate their Neighbours that ſuffer ſin upon them, do not they hate their Children that ſuffer them to live in ignorance of God, which is a Soul-damning ſin?</p>
                  <p>4. Children and Servants prove great croſſes when they are not trained up in the knowledge and fear of God. And this comes to paſs both by the juſt Judgment of God, who puniſheth Parents and Maſters neglect of Family-Inſtruction, with the diſobedient undutiful carriage of their Children and Servants; and alſo from the power of original corruption, which when it is not reſtrained by good education, breaks forth with great violence, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth perſons to be of a perverſe and ſtubborn ſpirit. <hi>Eli</hi> neglecting Family-Government was puniſhed in his Children, by their proving exceeding great croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.33. <hi>The man of thine whom I ſhall not cut off from mine Altar, ſhall be to conſume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart.</hi> And as God dealt with <hi>Eli,</hi> ſo he ordinarily deals with thoſe Parents that neglect to train up their Children in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of his Name; he ſuffers them to prove a reproach and grief to their Parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.15. <hi>The Rod and Reproof give wiſdom, but a Child left to himſelf bringeth his Mother to ſhame.</hi> Prov. 17 25. <hi>A fooliſh Son is a grief to his Father, and bitterneſs to her that bare him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The neglect of inſtructing our Families, and training them up in the fear of God, cauſeth God to inflict many great and ſore judgments on our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and ſuch as ſhall continue upon them from Generation to Generation: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>I have told him that I will judge his houſe for ever for the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which he knoweth, becauſe his Sons made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

For if we inſtruct our Children, and the Lord bleſs our Labours (and we have no cauſe to doubt of his Bleſſing, if we be diligent and faithful in our work) our Children will teach their Children, and their Children will teach the next Generation; and ſo by our means the knowledge of God and his Goſpel will be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Generation to Generation, as long as the world ſtands: For Children are very apt to walk in all thoſe ways that they ſee their Fathers walk in, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.43. <hi>And he walked in all the ways of Aſa his Father; he turned not aſide from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord. Solomon</hi> gives this reaſon why he taught his Children, his Father taught him when he was a Child, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1, 3, 4. <hi>Hear ye Children the inſtruction of a Father, and attend to know underſtanding, for I was my Fathers Son, tender and only beloved in the ſight of my Mother; He taught me alſo, and ſaid, Let thy heart retain my words, keep

And as our Children, ſo alſo our Servants whom we have inſtructed, when God ſhall give them Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they will teach their Houſholds the ways of the Lord, and ſuch as ſpring out of their Loyns will tread in their ſteps, and inſtruct their Families, whereby the Kingdom of Chriſt will be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. <hi>Solomon</hi> inſtructed his Servants, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. <hi>Happy are thy men, happy are theſe thy Servants, which ſtand continually before thee, and hear thy wiſdom.</hi> And we find the Children of <hi>Solomons</hi> Servants, who were generally reputed to be Profelites, that had embraced the Jewiſh Religion, ſpoken of in the Scriptures, and giving evidence of their Piety for many Generations after <hi>Solomon</hi>'s death, they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced their Piety by adhering to the Jews, who were the People and Church of the living God, and that when they were in a low condition, and under great miſery by reaſon of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102523:45"/>2. By their returning out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Ezra</hi> 2.1, 55. after they had dwelt in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> ſeventy years, where they had built Houſes and planted Vineyards, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.4, 5. and could not leave thoſe Houſes and Vineyards without much loſs. 3. The Children of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Servants are reckoned up amongſt thoſe that were moſt forward to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> unto <hi>Zion, Neh.</hi> 7.5, 6, 57. 4. They went out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to build the Houſe of the Lord, which was a great, coſtly, and difficult work, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.3, 5. compared with Chap. 2.1, 55. and that is a further evidence of their Piety, that they went not up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for their own ends, but that the Lord had ſtirred up their ſpirits to go thither to build the Lords Houſe. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſheweth that Inſtruction is a means to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Religion to many Generations; for from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to the carrying away of the Jews into <hi>Babylon,</hi> were thirteen Generations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.17. and from their going into <hi>Babylon,</hi> till their return from thence, ſeventy years, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29, 10.

Religion will be ſo propagated from one Family to another, and from one Generation to another, by the means of Family-Inſtruction, that hereby may be fulfilled what is ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.12. <hi>They that ſhall be of thee ſhall build the old waſte places, thou ſhalt raiſe up the foundations of many Generations; and thou ſhalt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The Repairer of the Breach, and the Reſtorer of Paths to dwell in.</hi> And hereby we may become an Eternal Excellency, the Joy of many Generations; and many Children that are yet unborn ſhall riſe up, and call us Bleſſed, and will have cauſe to bleſs God on our behalf to all Eternity.

                  <p>1. Inſtructing our Children and Servants out of the word of God, will be a means to bring them to lead holy, godly, and righteous Lives; and when our Families walk in the fear of God, and live righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102523:47"/>God is glorified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.21. <hi>Thy People alſo ſhall be all righteous—that I may be glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The good that our Children and Servants will receive by our inſtructing them out of the word of God, will be ſo great, that they will bleſs and praiſe God for it, as long as they live, yea to all eternity, ſo that hereby we ſhall bring eternal glory to God, for then and as long as God is praiſed he is glorified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>Whoſo offereth me praiſe, glorifieth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Family-Inſtruction glorifieth God, as it is a means to propagate Religion, and increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Converts, and to bring multitudes to become Servants of the Lord; for the more godly Families are erected, the more the number of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants is multiplied, the more God is glorified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.28. <hi>In the multitude of People is the Kings Honour.</hi> What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of earthly Kings, the ſame is true of the King of Heaven. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo informeth us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.15. That the increaſing of the number of Gods Servants, advanceth his glory: <hi>Thou haſt increaſed the Nation, O Lord, thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Nation; thou art glorified.</hi> And it hath been ſhewn before, that inſtructing our Families will be an effectual means of their Converſion, and will greatly propagate Religion, and the Power of Godlineſs from one Family to another, for many Generations. Now ſeeing Family-Inſtruction glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth God, we ſhould ſet our Heads and Hearts on work how to carry on this duty in the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and ſucceſsful manner; for we were every one created, and are maintained in our being for this very end, to glorifie God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.6, 7. <hi>Bring my Sons from far, and my Daughters from the end of the earth, even every one that is called by my name, for I

                  <p>Beſides theſe fore-mentioned Examples, we have the Patern and Example of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, who is greater than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or any Princes or Potentates that ever lived upon the face of the Earth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, that went whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, that lodged where he lodged, that eat and drank with him continually, were as I may ſo call them Chriſts Family, they called him by the name of Maſter, and he owned that name, <hi>John</hi> 13.13. <hi>Ye call me Maſter and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am:</hi> He went in and out amongſt them all the

Now if we look upon the Diſciples of Chriſt as his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then we have an excellent Pattern of Family-Inſtruction in the Example of our Lord Jeſus: For he was very diligent in teaching and inſtructing his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the men which thou gaveſt me out of the World.</hi> And that Chriſt inſtructed them out of the word of God, appears from verſ. 14. <hi>I have given them thy word.</hi> See alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 4. from verſ. 17. to 21. He did not only teach them with others in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, but did alſo inſtruct them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when they were alone with him: <hi>Mark</hi> 4.34. <hi>When they were alone, he expounded all things to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</hi> And not only before his death, but alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection, his great work among his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples was, to teach and expound to them the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27. <hi>And beginning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the things concerning himſelf?</hi> And veſ. 32. <hi>Did not our Hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> And verſ. 45, 46. <hi>Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures, and ſaid unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> &amp;c.

That one great end why God gives us Children, and why he continueth our Lives with our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and our Children with us, is, That we ſhould teach them his word; and to this agrees that note which <hi>Calvin</hi> hath upon this Text, <hi>Hinc colligenda eſt utilis monitio hac lege ſobolem dari mortalibus ut quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que liberos ſuos erudiendo pro ſua virili propagare ad poſteros ſtudeat Dei nomen.</hi> 2. When Parents have eſcaped with their Lives from the Peſtilence, or any other eminent danger, they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their gratitude to God, by teaching his Truth to their Children. This was <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s caſe, he had been ſick unto death, and his ſickneſs was (as many think) the Peſtilence, but he was preſerved from death, hereupon he praiſeth God, and tells us all living perſons that had eſcaped the Peſtilence ſhould do the like; and they ſhould not only praiſe God in words, but every Father ſhould expreſs his gratitude to God for preſerving him and his from going down to the Grave, by teaching Gods word to his Children.</item>

Whatſoever good thing we deſire to teach our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in order to their welfare in this world, or their eternal ſalvation in the world to come, it is contained in the Scriptures. Would we train up our Families in the knowledge of the Principles of Religion? The Scripture is profitable for Doctrine. Would we at any time reprove them for their ſins, or teach them how to reprove others? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profitable for Reproof. Would we correct and reform any Errors in Judgment, or in their Converſations? The Word of God is profitable for Correction. Would we teach and inſtruct them how to live righteous and holy Lives? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profitable for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, as the Apoſtle teſtifies, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The Scriptures are ſo framed by the infinite wiſdom of God, that they give directions for the doing of all good works, for the avoiding of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the reſiſting of all Temptations, the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Afflictions, the inſtructing all perſons of all ages, whatever ſtate or condition they are in.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102523:54"/>Babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</hi> Are they come to ſome maturity, both in reſpect of their years and their knowledge? In the word of God there is meat for ſtrong men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. Are the Members of our Families dull and backward, and ſluggiſh in reſpect of that which is good? Gods word is like a goad to prick and put them forward. Are they fickle and inconſtant in that which is good? Gods word prudently and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied, will be like a Nail to faſten and make them ſtedfaſt in every good work: <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.11. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as Goads, and as Nails faſtened by the Maſters of the Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd.</hi> Are our Children or Servants in an unconverted condition?

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. <hi>I kept back nothing that was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto you.</hi> Neither we nor our Children need the knowledge of any thing more than the whole Counſel of God concerning our Salvation, and this is fully revealed in the word of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God.</hi> Whatſoever Chriſt heard of the Father, that he taught his Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> And all things that Chriſt taught the Apoſtles, they are written in the Scriptures: <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>The former Treatiſe have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy Ghoſt had given Commandments unto the Apoſtles whom he had choſen.</hi> And therefore the Scriptures are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Righteouſneſs, containing all things that are neceſſary for any man to know, believe or practiſe, in order to his eternal ſalvation. And as the Scriptures are profitable for inſtruction, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the uſefulneſs and ſuitableneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in them; ſo alſo in regard of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is in them, to convince the Judgment, and to prevail with the Conſcience; and to bow and bend the will to a compliance with Gods will: For they carry the Authority of God with them, and work efficaciouſly upon the ſtouteſt hearts, when God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies them with his Spirit: <hi>Act.</hi> 18.28. <hi>He mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt:</hi> The Jews were exceedingly prejudiced againſt Chriſt, they were ſo far from believing that Jeſus was the Chriſt, that they had crucified him as an Impoſtor, and a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the People; yet <hi>Apollos</hi> bringing clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof for what he taught, the Jews were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102523:55"/>mightily convinced that Jeſus was the Chriſt. The <hi>word of God</hi> is of a more piercing nature than a <hi>ſword,</hi> and carrieth greater power along with it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and is a Diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> It aſtoniſheth the minds of men, and carries out their Souls to believe in and obey the Lord, notwithſtanding all Oppoſitions and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements that lie in the way either of Faith or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer was full of ſubtilty and miſchief, and he oppoſed all he could the word of God, which was diſpenced by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and ſought to turn away <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> from the Faith, but the Word of God had ſuch power upon the Deputy, that notwithſtanding all the endeavours of <hi>Elimas,</hi> he became obedient to the Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.12. <hi>The Deputy when he ſaw what was done believed, being aſtoniſhed at the Doctrine of the Lord.</hi> Of all the Jews none were more oppoſite to believing in Chriſt, than the Prieſts; for the Prieſts plotted and contrived Chriſts death, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.3, 4. They ſent <hi>Judas</hi> and a multitude of People with him to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt, verſ. 47. They ſuborned falſe witneſſes againſt him, verſ. 59. They held a Counſel after he was apprehended, by what means they ſhould put him to death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.1. The Prieſts accuſed him with great vehemency before <hi>Herod, Luk.</hi> 23.10. They ſtirred up the multitude to ask <hi>Barrabas,</hi> when <hi>Pilate</hi> was willing to have releaſed Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.20. It was the cry of the multitude that were ſtirred up by the Prieſts, and the voices of the Prieſts that prevailed with <hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.23. After the death of Chriſt, the Prieſts took greateſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102523:55"/>offence at the Apoſtles preaching, and were the chief Agents in their impriſonment, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.1. And yet notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that was in the Prieſts againſt Chriſt, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſuch was the power of the Word of God, that thereby a great number of the Prieſts were converted to the faith of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in Jeruſalem greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the Faith.</hi>

They open ſuch Myſteries as the Angels of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and delight to look into them: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> And ſhall we hide ſuch excellent things as theſe are, from our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? We ſhould reſolve with full purpoſe of heart as the godly Jews of old did concerning thoſe glorious things which their Fathers had told them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.4. <hi>We will not hide them from their Children,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102523:56"/>ſhewing to the Generations to come the praiſes of the Lord:</hi> I might adde further, There is nothing revealed in the Scriptures, but what is of great and near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us and to our Children, and that as long as we and they ſhall live in this world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi> If thoſe things that are treated of in the Scriptures, did not belong to us, or to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we might have ſome excuſe for not teaching them the word of God: But what Apologie can we make for our neglect of this Duty, ſeeing they were revealed purpoſely for us and our Children to be converſant therein as long as we live? They are of ſuch near and great concernment to us, as that every mans Judgment for his eternal ſtate ſhall be given at the laſt day, according to what is in the written word, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the words that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> Rev. 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God; and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life; and the Dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the Books, according to their works.</hi>

Juſtice requires that we ſhould give to every one that which is due to him: He that detains from any one that which is his due, when it is required, and it is in the power of his hand to render it, is an unjuſt man: Now Inſtruction is due to our Children and Servants; for God commands us, as we have heard before, to inſtruct them, and their neceſſity calleth aloud upon us to be diligent in teaching and inſtructing them; and therefore we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold inſtruction from them, without being guilty of injuſtice: And it is a great crime to be guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; Unjuſt perſons are accounted amongſt the chiefeſt of Sinners.

                  <p>1.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Inſtruct them in the knowledge of the Principles of Religion: As for inſtance: Teach them that there is a God, and that this God is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him: And who is the true God: That there is but one God, and that this one God ſubſiſteth in three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: That God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip Him muſt worſhip Him in Spirit and Truth: That God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, is every where preſent, Almighty, Eternal, Holy in all his Works, and Righteous in all his Ways, Faithful, Juſt, Abundant in Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That God made the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein, and Rules and Governs all his Creatures by his Wiſe and Gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: That Man was created in the Image of God, and ſinned againſt God by eating the Forbidden Fruit: That by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience all Men were made Sinners, and are by Nature the Children of Wrath; and that Judgement came upon all men to Condemnation: That God out of his great Love ſent his only begotten Son into the World, to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt: That JESUS of NAZARETH, who was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin MARY, ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der PONTIUS PILATE, was the promiſed MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH: That He died for our Sins, and roſe again the third day, and aſcended into Heaven where he ſitteth at the right hand of God, making interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for all that come to God by him; from whence He ſhall come again to judge the World in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: That God for Chriſt his ſake hath made a New Covenant, wherein he hath promiſed Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102523:60"/>of ſins, Sanctification, eternal Life, and all other good things freely to them that believe on his Son: That thoſe whom God hath ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life he calleth out of Darkneſs into Light, and turneth them from their ſins unto God, and unites them to Chriſt by faith, and puts his Spirit into them, and cauſeth them to walk in his Ways, and to ſerve him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of their Life: That there ſhall be a general Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Dead, both of the Juſt and Unjuſt, that after the Dead are raiſed, the whole world ſhall appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive according to what he hath done while his Soul lived in his Body: That ſuch as have lived and died in their ſins without Repentance ſhall be caſt into Hell, where they ſhall abide with the Devil and his Angels in everlaſting fire; And ſuch as have believed in Chriſt, and repented of their ſins, ſhall be received into Heaven, where they ſhall be ever with the Lord. It is neceſſary that you ſhould teach your Children and Servants the knowledge of the Principles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Ye have need that one teach you again which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> For Knowledge is the foundation of Practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.34. <hi>Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2. <hi>Alſo that the Soul be without knowledge, it is not good.</hi>—And as you muſt teach them the knowledge of the Principles, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the practiſe of the Duties of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as to believe in Chriſt, to repent of their ſins, to love God with all their Hearts, and to love their Neighbours as themſelves; to do the ſame things unto others, which they would that others
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102523:60"/>ſhould do unto them, to deny themſelves, to love their Enemies, to do good to them that hate them; to read, hear, and meditate on Gods Words, to be contented in every eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Knowledge without Obedience will be ſo far from leading them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, that it will make them have the greater condemnation: <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>That Servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> But by teaching your Families both to know and do the will of God, you ſhall make them partakers of eternal Happineſs: <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if you do them.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his Son, he taught him both to know and ſerve the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Teach them nothing but the Truth: Do not pervert and wreſt the Scriptures to their and your own deſtruction. Do not give them poy ſon inſtead of the ſincere milk of the Word: It was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles to teach nothing but the Truth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Maſter we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth:</hi> 2 Cor. 2.17. <hi>We are not as many which corrupt the word of God, but as of ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt:</hi> By teaching them the Word of God in truth, you ſhall be inſtrumental to their Regeneration: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, with the word of Truth;</hi> and the rendring of them fruitful in good works, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth alſo in you, ſince the day that ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</hi> And be a means of ſaving their Souls: for it is by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102523:61"/>and belief of the Truth that we are brought to ſalvation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.25. <hi>A true witneſs delivereth Souls:</hi> By a true Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we may underſtand one that inſtructeth thoſe that are under his Charge in the knowledge of the Truth: The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which we render a Witneſs, is ſometimes uſed, as <hi>Kircher</hi> obſerves, <hi>pro predicatore,</hi> for a Teacher; and we find the word Witneſs uſed in this ſignification, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.16. <hi>To make thee a Miniſter and a Witneſs.</hi> And then the words may have this ſence, That teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing perſons in the knowledge of the Truth, is a means to deliver their Souls from eternal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Teach them Soul-ſaving Truths. By Soul-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truths, I mean ſuch Truths as will be a certain and infallible means of ſaving your Children and Servants Souls, if they be rightly underſtood, firmly believed, and ſincerely practiſed.</p>
                  <p>If you ask, What are thoſe Truths which will be a means of ſaving our Children and Servants Souls, if we teach them to our Families?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: Such as theſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. Teach them to know GOD and his Son JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST; by ſo doing you ſhall guide them into the path of Life: For <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal, That they may know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Teach them their loſt and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Nature; their need of, and their miſery without Jeſus Chriſt, and the way and means by which they may come to be partakers of Chriſt: For if you can draw them to Chriſt, they ſhall not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102523:61"/>miſs of eternal Life: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. Explain to them the Covenant of Grace, what great Mercies and Bleſſings are contained in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; that their Souls may long to be brought under the Bond of the Covenant; ſhew them alſo how and by what means they may get into Covenant with God: for if you can bring them to lay hold upon the Covenant of Grace, you ſhall make them Partakers of Salvation: for eternal Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is promiſed to ſuch as are in Covenant with God: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>He hath made with me an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant—and this is all my Salvation.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Shew them the nature, neceſſity, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of faith in Chriſt, and labour to bring them to believe in Jeſus Chriſt: If they be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, they ſhall certainly have everlaſting Life: <hi>John</hi> 6.47. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlaſting Life.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. Teach them the nature and neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and preſs home upon them ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as may ſtir them up to the practice and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Repentance; if you can by any means bring them to a true and unfeigned Repentance, you ſhall thereby ſave their Souls: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 16. <hi>Again, when I ſay to the Wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, if he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right— he ſhall ſurely live.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. Teach them to ſerve and obey the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for he will ſave all thoſe that obey him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>7. Teach them to love God with all their Hearts and Souls; and to love Him above all Perſons and Things that are in the world: Eternal Life is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102523:62"/>to ſuch as love God: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>8. Teach them to fear and reverence the Lord; and that you may breed the fear of the Lord in their Souls, acquaint them with the Power, Holineſs, Goodneſs, Juſtice, Omniſcience, and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and his other glorious Attributes: for the fear of the Lord ariſeth from, and is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the knowledge of God, <hi>Job</hi> 37.23, 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.5. and put them in mind of Gods Covenant, wherein the Lord hath promiſed to put his fear into our hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. If you can bring your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to fear the Lord, you ſhall ſave their Souls; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.23. <hi>The fear of the Lord tendeth to life;</hi> Pſal. 145.19. <hi>He will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him, he alſo will hear their Cry, and will ſave them.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>9. Teach them to hope in God, for all thoſe good things which are promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, and to keep up their hope in God under all their troubles and temptations; by hoping in God, they ſhall obtain the ſalvation of their Souls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>We are ſaved by hope.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>10. Teach them the nature of Prayer, to whom they muſt pray, and for what; and how they muſt pray, if they would find acceptance with God: The Lord Jeſus taught his Diſciples how to pray, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did the like to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1. <hi>One of his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Lord teach us to pray, as John alſo taught his Diſciples.</hi> By teaching your Families to call upon God in an acceptable manner, you ſhall promote their ſalvation; <hi>For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Rom. 10.13.</item>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102523:62"/>
                        <item>11. Teach them to be ſincere, and to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly with God; for if they walk uprightly they ſhall be ſaved; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Whoſo walketh uprightly ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>12. Teach them to wait upon God in all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to wait for the accompliſhment of all his Promiſes. They that wait on the Lord are under a promiſe of Salvation: <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and he ſhall ſave thee.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>13. Teach them the way to obtain the Remiſſion of their ſins: for if they obtain the pardon of their ſins, they ſhall be in a bleſſed condition; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven.</hi>—And ſhall obtain everlaſting life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>14. Teach them to avoid evil company, and to walk and converſe with ſuch as fear God, that may prove a means of their ſalvation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Forſake the fooliſh and live; and go in the way of underſtanding:</hi> Prov. 15.20, <hi>He that walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>15. Exhort them to perſevere in the faith of Chriſt, and to continue in their obedience of his Commandments as long as they live; for in ſo doing, they ſhall aſſuredly obtain everlaſting life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life:</hi> Matth. 24.13. <hi>He that ſhall endure to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> In a word, whatever Duties have a promiſe of Salvation annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the performance of them, inſtruct them in the nature, and ſtir them up to the practice of thoſe Duties.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Teach them Seaſonable Truths: The more ſuitable and ſeaſonable the Inſtructions are, which you give your Families, the more good they will
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102523:63"/>receive from them; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.23. <hi>A man hath joy by the anſwer of his mouth, and a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon how good is it?</hi> By teaching them ſeaſonable Truths, I mean,
<list>
                        <item>1. That you ſhould ſuit your Inſtructions to their ſtate and condition, whether they be in a ſtate of nature or a ſtate of grace; under temptations and ſpiritual trouble, or free from it; in a ſleepy ſecure condition, or in an awakened, convinced condition, but not converted: or if converted, conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go forward, and walk as becometh the Goſpel; or whether they decline and walk unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their profeſſion.</item>
                        <item>2. Caution them againſt the ſins of the times and places where they live, or where their lot is like to be caſt in time to come; and caution them againſt the ſins that their age, condition, conſtitution, or calling, are liable to be aſſaulted withall. Thus the Apoſtle counſels <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a young man, to flee youthful luſts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. and cautions him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch ſins as he would be incident to in the diſcharge of his Calling, as Partiality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. Raſhneſs, verſ. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. Have an eye to the various Diſpenſations of Gods Providence, both towards the Nation, and your own or other Neighbouring Families, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them how to improve ſuch Providences. As for inſtance, if the Lord ſend the Sword, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or Famine, or any other great Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation, teach them what duties God expects from them under ſuch Judgments, and what means they ſhould uſe that they may be hid in the day of the Lords anger, and be preſerved in time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity. Or if God ſend ſickneſs, or death or any other affliction, into your own or your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102523:63"/>Neighbouring Families, teach them what uſe they ſhould make of ſuch afflictions.</item>
                        <item>4. If there ariſe any errors, or any Seducers come into the places where you live, caution them againſt thoſe errors, and bid them beware of thoſe Seducers, and eſtabliſh their Judgments in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe Truths which are oppoſite to thoſe Errors, that ſo they may not be led away by them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suit your Inſtructions to their Capacities, and teach them ſuch things as they are moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to underſtand. When our LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST inſtructed the People, he had reſpect unto the Capacities of his Hearers, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33. <hi>With many ſuch Parables ſpake He the Word unto them, as they were able to bear:</hi> John 16.12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> The like alſo we may ſee in his Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>And I Brethren, could not ſpeak unto you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as unto Babes in Chriſt. I have fed you with Milk, and not with Meat: For hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet are ye now able.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 3.</hi> What manner of Inſtruction is moſt edifying? What are edifying Duties?</head>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>3</label> IF you would convert, edifie and ſave the Souls of ſuch as are under your charge, by thoſe Inſtructions which you give unto them, do not only teach them ſound and Soul-ſaving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but teach them in an edifying manner: The manner as well as the matter of Inſtruction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102523:64"/>conduceth much to edification: <hi>Act.</hi> 14.1. <hi>They SO ſpake, that a great multitude both of the Jews, and alſo of, the Greeks, believed:</hi> There is an emphaſis in the word <hi>ſo,</hi> which reſpecteth the manner of their teaching; the manner of their teaching was ſuch, that it became ſucceſsful for the converting of great multitudes to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, In what manner ſhould we teach our Families, ſo as to promote their Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>1. Search out ſuitable and pertinent Scriptures for proving and explaining thoſe points wherein you purpoſe to inſtruct them, and digeſt them into a good method. Such a courſe as this the Preacher took in teaching the people, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he ſtill taught the people knowledge, yea, he gave good heed, and ſought out and ſet in order many Proverbs.</hi> And by his ſelecting choice portions of Scripture, and ſetting them in order, his words became like Goads and Nails, that pierced deep, and ſtuck faſt in the hearts of his Hearers, verſ. 11. The Word of God aptly and rightly applied, hath great force to work upon the Conſcience; <hi>Job</hi> 6.25. <hi>How forcible are right words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Explain the ſence and meaning of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which you teach your Families, if they contain any difficulties that are above their underſtandings, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8. <hi>So they read in the Book in the Law of God, and gave the ſence, and cauſed them to underſand the reading.</hi> The Lord commanded the Jews not only to train up their Children in the uſe, but to teach them the meaning of his Ordinances, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs when your Children ſhall ſay unto you, What mean you by this ſervice? That ye ſhall
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102523:64"/>ſay, It is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſover, who paſſed over the Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. The plainer you make the Truths which you teach your Families, the greater efficacy they will have upon their hearts to produce Faith and Obedience: <hi>John</hi> 16.29, 30. <hi>Lo now thou ſpeakeſt plainly, and ſpeakeſt no Proverbs: Now are we ſure that thou knoweſt all things.—By this we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>3. Teach them that the Scriptures are the word of God, and adviſe them to receive thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Reproofs, and Exhortations, which you give them out of the Scriptures, not as yours, but as the Counſels, Reproofs, and Exhortations of God. Exhort them to look upon the Doctrines, Precepts, Threatnings, Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are contained in the Scriptures, to be as truly and really the word of God, and to be embraced with the ſame Faith and ready Obedience as if they heard God ſpeaking the ſame things with an audible Voice from Heaven. This perſwaſion will make thoſe Inſtructions which you give them out of the Scriptures to take place, and work effectually upon their hearts, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.—<hi>When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which worketh effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Teach them to make a particular application to their own Souls of thoſe Inſtructions which you give them out of the Scriptures. As the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> made a particular application of what he taught the Prieſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And now, O ye Prieſts, this Commandment is for you:</hi> So muſt Parents deal with their Children: O my Children, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of keeping holy the Sabbath day, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God with all your heart, and your Neighbour
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102523:65"/>as your ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is for you: And this Threatning, <hi>If you live after the fleſh you ſhall die, the Companion of Fools ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c. is for you; you ſhall die as well as any perſons in the world, if ye live after the fleſh, and if ye will keep evil company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this promiſe is for you, <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall want no good thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If you will ſeek the Lord he will give you all good things:</hi> And the example of Gods Judgments on ſuch as murmured, and ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was written for your admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to deter you from committing thoſe ſins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8, 10, 11. When <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing <hi>Job</hi> in ſeveral things concerning the miſery of wicked men, the nature of afflictions, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God beſtoweth on godly men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his diſcourſe thus, <hi>Job</hi> 5.27. <hi>Lo this we have ſearched it, ſo it is, hear it, and know it for thy good;</hi> (or as it is in the Margin) <hi>for thy ſelf.</hi> From the different rendring of the laſt clauſe of this Verſe, we may draw this note, That then a man knows Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths for his good, when he knows them for himſelf; that is, the way for a man to get good by the knowledge of Divine Truths, is to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application of them to his own Soul.</p>
                  <p>5. When you inſtruct them in the performance of any duty, either towards God or their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, teach them how and in what manner to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that duty; ſhew them alſo the neceſſity of it, and the advantages and benefits that will come to them if they follow your counſel, and the evils that will befall them if they neglect it. Thus <hi>David</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed <hi>Solomon,</hi> he exhorts him to know and ſerve the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him</hi>— Then he ſhews him in what manner he muſt ſerve the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102523:65"/>Lord, willingly and ſincerely, <hi>Serve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, and with a willing mind:</hi> He tells him why it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſerve the Lord with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: <hi>For the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the thoughts:</hi> He acquaints him alſo with the benefit that he ſhould receive if he would ſeek and ſerve the Lord—<hi>If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee;</hi> and with the evils that would come upon him if he forſook the Lord—<hi>But if thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.10. <hi>The Preacher ſought out accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words,</hi> or as ſome render it, <hi>verba deſiderii,</hi> words that might ſtir up deſires after thoſe things which he taught the people, words that might win and gain upon their affections. Follow <hi>Solomon</hi>'s example in teaching your Children, ſeek out ſuch Scriptures as may put an edge upon their affections, and inflame them with a deſire to practiſe thoſe things which you teach them to be their duty. Conſider alſo what may dicourage or hinder them from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe Duties which you preſs upon them, and endeavour to remove thoſe hindrances: for what the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. the ſame is true here, <hi>That which now letteth, will let, until it be taken out of the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. So teach them their duty, as alſo to direct them where they may have ſtrength to perform it. And to that end guide them to Chriſt, without whom they can do nothing, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing;</hi> and by whoſe help they ſhall be able to do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> By which means, when they find no ſtrength in themſelves, they ſhall be able to ſay they have it in Chriſt: <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102523:66"/>Lord have I Righteouſneſs and Strength,</hi> Iſa. 45.24. And ſeeing Chriſt conveys his ſtrength to us in a way of Reliance upon him, (for it is through faith that out of weakneſs we are made ſtrong, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34.) and ſeeing faith is helped much by the promiſes, when you inſtruct them in their duty, guide them to ſome promiſe of the Covenant of Grace, where God hath promiſed to inable them to perform that duty; that ſo by the help of the promiſes they may truſt in Chriſt to work all their works in them and for them, and may through faith in him receive ſtrength to walk before God in newneſs of Life. Thus when the Apoſtle taught the <hi>Romans</hi> that they ſhould not let ſin have dominion over them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal Bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof:</hi> He preſently puts them in mind of a promiſe, wherein the Lord hath promiſed ſo to over-rule us by his grace, that ſin ſhall not have the Dominion over us, verſ. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have the Dominion over you. for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. If you would ſo inſtruct your Families as to edifie them in your Teaching, then ſtir them up to the practiſe of thoſe Duties which make for their edification: As,

                  <p>Now concerning the times and ſeaſons that you
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102523:67"/>ſhould take for the doing this work: I ſhall give four or five directions.</p>
                  <p>1. Let this work be done when there is greateſt quiet in the Family, not at ſuch a time as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Family are diſtracted or cumbred with variety or a multitude of worldly buſineſs, or when their Spirits are royled with paſſion or contention, but when they are in the moſt quiet and compoſed frame; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The words of wiſe men are heard in quiet.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.35. <hi>That you may attend upon the Lord without diſtraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Let this work be done often; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another:</hi> Deut. 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children.</hi> God worketh many ways and often times with us, to bring about our ſalvation: <hi>Job</hi> 33.29, 30. <hi>Lo all theſe things worketh God often times with man, to bring back his Soul from the pit, to be enlightned with the light of the Living.</hi> And ſhall we think much to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and frequent in teaching our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that their Souls may be kept from falling into the pit of Hell; and that they may be enlightned with that knowledge which will make them wiſe to Salvation?</p>
                  <p>3. It will be convenient to have fixed and ſtated times for the doing of this work, that ſo the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be the better prepared for it, and all family-occaſions may be ſo ordered, and all buſineſs ſet at ſuch a ſtay, as that every one may be at liberty and leaſure to attend this work.</p>
                  <p>4. Avocations and Diverſions ſhould not be eaſily yielded to, for the putting by our intended exerciſe at the appointed time. As for inſtance: If Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany come in, though they be great Perſons, and ſuch as are our Superiours, we ſhould not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102523:67"/>to go on with our works <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 46. <hi>I will ſpeak of thy Teſtimonies alſo before Kings, and will not be aſhamed.</hi> And if we be at any time diverted by ſome unexpected and urgent occaſions, we ſhould redeem that loſs by taking ſome other time for their inſtruction, as ſoon as conveniently we can.</p>
                  <p>5. We ſhould take ſuch times wherein both we and our Families are freſh and lively, not over-tired with worldly buſineſs, not heavy with ſleep; for we muſt be fervent in ſpirit when we ſerve the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. and when the Body is tired, or heavy with ſleep, the Spirit is not likely to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                  <p>6. The Lords day (which is to be ſpent in holy and Religions Exerciſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13.) is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time for this work. It was the Cuſtom of the Jews to read the Scriptures in their Synagogues every Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</hi> And we need not doubt but they did the ſame in their Families, ſeeing they were commanded by God to read ſome portion of his word every day as long as they lived; yea, their greateſt men, even their Kings, who had the weightieſt buſineſs of all other men lying upon their hands, were not excuſed from this Law of daily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures; <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. <hi>And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book—And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and theſe Statutes, to do them.</hi> I ſhall not undertake to preſcribe what other days, beſides Lords days, Maſters of Families ſhould take for this work, but ſhall leave that to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102523:68"/>their own prudence and diſcretion: Only I ſhall ſay this, That they for whom God hath done much, and who have more ſpare time than others, ſhould be more frequent and abundant in this work: For <hi>unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> Luk. 12.48.</p>

The Prophets of God charge us in Gods name to remember the word of the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4 4. <hi>Remember ye the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my Servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the Statues and Judgments.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt when he was in the world charged us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his word, <hi>John</hi> xv. 20. <hi>Remember the word that I ſaid unto you.</hi> The Apoſtles alſo call upon us to keep in memory Gods word, <hi>Jude</hi> 17. <hi>Beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ye the words that were ſpoken before of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Acts 20.35 <hi>I have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102523:68"/>ſhewn you all things, how that ſo labouring ye ought to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Heb. 2.1. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have heard, leſt at any time we let them ſlip.</hi> The holy Angels when they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe that came to Chriſts Sepulchre, bid them remember the words of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.6. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he ſpake unto you, when he was yet in Galilee.</hi> One great benefit which we have by the holy Ghoſt, is, his helping us to remember Gods word: <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſeen how earneſtly this duty is preſſed upon us, now let us ſee what advantages will come to us by remembring Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>1. It will be an help to Faith, <hi>John</hi> 2.22. <hi>When he was riſen from the dead, his Diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It helps us in our obedience; <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.40. <hi>That ye may remember, and do all my Commandments, and be holy unto your God:</hi> Pſal. 119.55. <hi>I have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred thy name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It is an help to Repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. <hi>And Peter remembred the words of Jeſus,—and he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It promotes our Comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.52. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred thy Judgments of old, O Lord, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It will breed a ſpiritual frame of heart; for if Gods word be treaſured up in our hearts, it will be in our minds night and day: <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.21, 22. <hi>Bind

                  </p>

Reproofs grounded upon the Word of God, and wiſely adminiſtred, will be a great furtherance of their Souls ſalvation, as you may ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light, and Reproofs of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are the way of Life:</hi> The ſence of which, is this, the Law of God gives us Light and Direction how to order our Converſations aright; and when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are inſtructed out of this Law, and reproved when they go aſtray from it, this is the way to ſave their Souls. Although ſome perſons in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſhould be addicted to lying, and other hainous ſins, and have been habituated to them for a long ſeaſon, yet you may hope by inſtructing and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, according to the Rules of Gods Word, that you ſhall reclaim them from their Vices, and make them ſound and ſincere Chriſtians. The <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were notorious Lyars, and ſo given to ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they ſeemed more like Beaſts than Men, ſlothful perſons that minded little elſe but their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; yet the Apoſtle would not have <hi>Titus</hi> deſpair
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102523:71"/>of reforming them, and making theſe <hi>Cretians</hi> ſound and good Chriſtians: And what courſe doth he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Titus</hi> unto, whereby he might hope to effect this, but to inſtruct them in the faith of Chriſt, and rebuke them ſharply: <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>The Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are always Lyars, evil Beaſts, ſlow Bellies; This wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is true; wherefore rebuke them ſharply, that they may be ſound in the faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, <hi>How ſhall we manage this duty of Reproof, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe perſons whom we reprove?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>1. Reprove not but upon juſt cauſe, and let that cauſe be for ſomething you know and can prove to be a ſin againſt God. Thus God deals with us; when he rebukes us, 'tis for ſin; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity</hi>—John 16.8. <hi>When he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin</hi>—If we commit ſin, though it be ſecretly, God will not let it paſs without a reproof, <hi>Job</hi> 13.10. <hi>He will ſurely reprove you, if you do ſecretly accept perſons.</hi> If your Children or Servants be guilty of lying, ſwearing, back-biting, or any other ſin, by no means forbear to rebuke them for their ſins: <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> You muſt alſo know and be ſure that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom you reprove, is guilty of that ſin for which you reprove him. And therefore you muſt not reprove upon every ſlight and groundleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.3. <hi>He ſhall not reprove after the hearing of the Ears:</hi> But you muſt inquire whether the thing that you hear be certain, and whether it be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102523:71"/>ſo bad as is reported. God teacheth us this by his own example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Becauſe the Cry of Sodom and Gomerrah is great, and becauſe their ſin is very grievous, I will go down now and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the Cry of it which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</hi> And he gives us a charge to be very wary how we proceed in judging others, till we have made full and certain enquiry into the matter of Fact, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12, 14. <hi>If thou ſhalt hear ſay in one of thy Cities—Then thou ſhalt inquire, and make ſearch, and ask diligently, and behold if it be truth, and the thing certain, that ſuch abomination is wrought among you.</hi> —</p>
                  <p>2. The Lord doth not always chide, as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.9. <hi>He will not always chide,</hi> but takes his ſet times for rebuking of us, ſuch as he in his wiſdom judgeth moſt meet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.34. In like manner, we muſt not be always chiding our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, leſt we either break or ſink their ſpirits, or elſe make them careleſs or regardleſs of our reproofs, but it will be our prudence, when we meet with that which provoketh us to anger, and deſerveth reproof, to defer it to a convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and when we reprove, to do it effectually and to purpoſe: <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>The diſcretion of a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. When you reprove your Servants or Children, inſtruct and ſhew them the evil of thoſe things for which you reprove them: And put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſome Scripture that doth ſet out moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and convincingly the evil and danger of that ſin for which you reprove them. And if they have no ſuch Scriptures in their remembrance, it will be good to cauſe them to take their Bibles and turn to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102523:72"/>ſuch Scriptures as are moſt pertinent to faſten upon their hearts that word of reproof which you ſhall give them. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to joyn Doctrine with Reproof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Reprove, Rebuke,—with Doctrine.</hi> When Chriſt reproved the <hi>Saduces</hi> for holding there was no Reſurrection of the Dead, he proves to them out of the Scriptures that they were in a great Error, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29, 31, 32. Divers inſtances we have of the like nature, in his repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Scribes and Phariſees, wherein he joyns the quotation of the Scriptures with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</p>
                  <p>4. If you ſee no fruit, no amendment produced by thoſe Reproofs which you give your Family, you muſt not ſit down diſcouraged, but reprove again and again, and exerciſe much patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the performance of this duty, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> What God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.8. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the firſt ſign, that they will believe the voice of the latter ſign.</hi> The like may I ſay here, If they turn not at the firſt Reproof, it may be they will at the ſecond; if not at the ſecond, it may be the third will prevail; but if it ſhould not, you muſt not ceaſe to do your duty, though God ſhould deny ſucceſs, but muſt be often dealing with them, and ſet before them the great danger of going on in ſin after they have been often reproved, concerning which we meet with many awakening paſſages in Scripture, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy:</hi> Prov. 15.10. <hi>He that hateth reproof ſhall die:</hi> See alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25. to verſe 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:102523:72"/>
                  <p>5. Do not reprove them in a fury, or when you are in a paſſion: <hi>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Jam. 1.20. We are all ready to pray with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38.1. <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chaſten me in thy diſpleaſure.</hi> If we would not have our Lord and Father rebuke us in his wrath, ſhall we rebuke our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in our wrath? Let this be far from us. We ſhould put on a ſpirit of Meekneſs, when we ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this work of Reproof. Two Conſiderations may cauſe us to exerciſe a ſpirit of Meekneſs when we are to deal with Offenders: Firſt, When we conſider what we our ſelves have been; by nature we are as bad as others: <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2, 3.—<hi>Shewing all meekneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, for we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Secondly, When we conſider what we may be, if we fall into temptation: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a man be over-taken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs; conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> Our Spirits may be meek, and yet our Reproofs may be ſharp, if either the nature of the Offence or Offender require ſharp reprehenſions. If we would have our Reproofs ſharp, ſuch as may enter and pierce deep into their hearts, the way is not to uſe bitter Invectives, and rayling Expreſſions, but rather, 1. To convince them plainly and clearly of their ſin for which we reprove them: Thus <hi>Peter</hi> dealt with the Jews, he gives them clear and certain demonſtrations that that Perſon whom they had put to death was the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that pricked them to the heart; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37. <hi>Let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made the ſame Jeſus whom you have crucified, both Lord
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102523:73"/>Lord and Chriſt. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart</hi>— 2. To demonſtrate to them out of the word of God the evil and danger of thoſe things for which you rebuke them: for Gods word is called the Sword of the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. No ſword cuts and pierces like the <hi>ſword of the Spirit. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Soul and Spirit, and the Joynts and Marrow, and is a Diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12.</p>
                  <p>6. Reprove with wiſdom, for when a Reproof is managed wiſely, it becomes more amiable and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.12. <hi>As an ear-ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold, ſo is a wiſe Reprover upon an obedient ear.</hi> Our wiſdom muſt be diſcovered in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fitteſt time for giving a Reproof, and doing it in a judicious manner, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.5. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and judgment:</hi> We muſt take the fitteſt time, we muſt not defer too long: We muſt do it when we are in the beſt capacity to give, and the offending party to receive a Reproof: We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove with Judgement, which will teach us to weigh and conſider the nature of the Offence, and the Offender. Some perſons are of a more ſoftly yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition than others; a word will do more with one, than many blows with another; <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.10. <hi>A Reproof entreth more into a wiſe man, than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtripes into a fool.</hi> Some Offences are more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous for their own nature, and for their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than others. In ſome caſes we are to rebuke ſecretly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. —<hi>Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.</hi>—In ſome caſes we are to rebuke publickly in the preſence of all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Them that ſin rebuke before all, that others alſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102523:73"/>may fear.</hi> Wiſdom will direct us what to do in theſe and other ſuch like Caſes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is profitable to direct.</hi> And that we may manage this work the more wiſely, we muſt not go about it raſhly, but conſult with our ſelves about the fitteſt ſeaſon and beſt manner of giving a Reproof: <hi>Neb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Then I conſulted with my ſelf, and rebuked the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> Prov. 13.10. <hi>With the well-adviſed is wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Look to God for Direction, Courage, and Succeſs, in giving a Reproof, and reſt upon him for his bleſſing; for the ſucceſs of every work we take in hand, depends upon Gods bleſſing: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt pray to God to aſſiſt, accept, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per us in this work. And as we muſt pray, ſo alſo reſt upon God for his bleſſing in the adminiſtring a Reproof; whether it be to ſuch as are unconverted, or to ſuch as are in a ſtate of Grace; for God hath promiſed to bleſs Reproof to both ſorts: To ſuch as are gracious, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.25. <hi>Reprove one that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and he will underſtand knowledge:</hi> To ſuch as are yet in their ſins, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.25. <hi>To them that rebuke him</hi> (that is, a wicked perſon ſpoken of ver. 24.) <hi>ſhall be delight, and a good bleſſing ſhall come upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Reprove and tell them of their faults with a tender compaſſionate heart, not in an inſulting way, or in a way of jeſting or jearing, but rather mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them, and for them; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>—When the Apoſtle wrote an Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to reprove them for their indulging the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, he tells them, <hi>Out of much affliction and anguiſh of heart I wrote unto you, with many tears,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.4.</p>

Correction joyned with Inſtruction, rightly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, is the way to make our Children holy and gracious, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.15. <hi>The Rod and Reproof give Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but a Child left to himſelf bringeth his Mother to ſhame.</hi> It maketh Children prove great bleſſings and comforts to their Parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.17. <hi>Correct thy Son, and he ſhall give thee reſt; yea, he ſhall give de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light unto thy Soul:</hi> Correction will be a means of preventing their eternal Damnation, by effecting their Reformation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.13, 14. <hi>With-hold not Correction from the Child, for if thou beateſt him with the Rod, he ſhall not die: Thou ſhalt beat him with the Rod, and ſhalt deliver his Soul from Hell.</hi> Though they be never ſo much addicted to any ſin, which ſeems to be deeply and faſt rooted in their Souls, Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction prudently and rightly adminiſtred, will be a means to reform them, and make them leave their ſins: <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a Child, but the Rod of Correction will drive it far from him:</hi> Prov. 20.30. <hi>The blueneſs of a wound cleanſeth away evil, ſo do ſtripes the inward parts of the Belly.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:102523:74"/>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>1. Begin with them betimes, before they have got too great an head, or are habituated to ſin: A Twig is eaſily bent and made ſtraight whilſt it is young, but being let alone for ſome years, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inflexible: <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Chaſten thy Son while there is hope:</hi> Prov. 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth his Rod, hateth his Son, but he that loveth him chaſteneth him betimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Be not overcome with fond pity, either by their crying or pleading with you to with-hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from them when you ſee it meet and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to correct them; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Chaſten thy Son while there is hope, and let not thy Soul ſpare for his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> They had better cry and roar under your Rod, than roar under Gods wrath in Hell to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>3. Joyn Faith and Prayer with your Corrections. Pray to God to bleſs the Corrections as well as the Inſtructions which you give your Children; and though you ſee no preſent fruit of your Corrections, yet be not diſcouraged, but reſt upon Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who hath promiſed that Correction ſhall make our Children leave their ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. and be a means to ſave their ſouls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>4. In correcting your Children, imitate God in correcting his Children: As for inſtance, 1. God joyns Inſtruction with Correction, and thereby his Corrections come to have a bleſſed effect upon his Children: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and reacheſt him out of thy Law:</hi> Deal thus with your Children; when you chaſten them, teach them out of the Scriptures the evil of thoſe things for which you correct them. 2. When <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:102523:75"/>chaſtens, he doth not only ſhew us our ſins, but layeth his commands upon us, to leave off our ſins, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, 10. <hi>If they be holden in cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their work and their tranſgreſſion that they have exceeded; he openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> So ſhould you charge and command your Children that they ſin no more when you correct them. 3. God is not extream to correct for every ſmall fault, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark iniquities, O Lord who ſhall ſtand?</hi> If any thing be done ignorantly, he is ready to wink at that, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>The times of this ignorance God winked at</hi>— 4. God diſtinguiſheth between his Children: Such as are dutiful diligent Children, ſhall not be corrected ſo ſmartly as thoſe that are careleſs and negligent, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi> 5. When Gods deareſt Children need Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and he ſeeth it is for their good, they ſhall have it as well as others: So ſhould you do; If you have any Child which is dearer and more delightful than the reſt, you ſhould correct that as well as the others, when it needs Correction. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a Father the Son in whom he delighteth.</hi> 6. The Lord corrects in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi> He is careful not to break or ſink his peoples Spirits by his Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth, for the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Soul which I have made.</hi> In like manner, you ſhould be careful that you do not correct your Children out of meaſure, or ſo as to ſink and quench their Spirits. 7. God doth not correct his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in anger, but out of love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102523:75"/>as I love, I rebuke and chaſten:</hi> And as he corrects in love, ſo he doth aim at their good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They verily for a few days chaſtened us after their own pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his Holineſs.</hi> In like manner, when you correct your Children, let it not be in paſſion, but out of love to their Souls, and with a deſire and deſign to do them good. 8. God tries to reform his Children firſt by leſſer and more gentle afflictions; and when they will not prevail to reform them, then he deals more ſeverely with them, and will not leave follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with one correction after another, till he hath humbled and reformed them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1. <hi>At the firſt he lightly afflicted the Land of Zebulun and Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali, and afterwards did more grievouſly afflict her by the way of the Sea:</hi> Lev. 26.23, 24. <hi>If ye will not be reformed by theſe things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins.</hi> So ſhould you firſt try more gentle means, and if that will not prevail, chaſtiſe them more ſeverely, and be not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from inſtructing and correcting them, till you have humbled and ſubdued their ſpirits, and cauſed them to reform their lives.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Be careful to honour God, to ſubmit and ſubject your ſelves unto him, and then he will cauſe your Families to honour you, and to ſubmit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to your Commands; It is God that inclines mens hearts to honour us, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12. <hi>Both Riches and Honour come of thee:</hi> And when we are vilified, flighted, and diſregarded, this alſo is of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.13. <hi>Thou makeſt us a reproach to our
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102523:76"/>Neighbours, a ſcorn and deriſion to them that are round about us:</hi> It is God that ſubdues the hearts of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, and other inferiours, and makes them ſubject to their Superiours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.47. <hi>It is God that avengeth me, and ſubdueth the people under me.</hi> And it is a Judgment which the Lord layeth upon us, when our Children or Servants carry themſelves proudly or diſobediently towards us: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The Child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the Ancient, and the Baſe againſt the Honourable.</hi> Now if we be careful to glorifie God, he will cauſe us to be honoured; if we ſlight or diſregard him, he will cauſe us to be deſpiſed: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> If we ſubmit our ſelves to God, he will cauſe our Wives, and Children, and Servants to ſubmit themſelves unto us, <hi>James</hi> 4.7, 10. <hi>Submit your ſelves therefore to God,—Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up:</hi> By lifting up, is not only meant deliverance out of trouble, but it implieth alſo that God will cauſe thoſe that ſubmit themſelves to him to be honoured and reverenced, he will lift them up in the hearts and eſtimation of all ſorts of men, that they ſhall carry themſelves reſpectively towards them. But if we rebel againſt God, he will raiſe up evil againſt us out of our own Houſes, and cauſe ſome or other of our Families to carry themſelves rebelliouſly and contemptuouſly towards us. Thus when <hi>David</hi> had deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, God raiſed up evil againſt him out of his own Houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9, 11. Whilſt he walked in the ways of God, all ſorts of perſons, ſtrangers as well as his own people, were ſubject to him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.43, 44. <hi>A people whom I have not known ſhall ſerve me; as ſoon as they hear of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102523:77"/>me, they ſhall obey me, the ſtrangers ſhall ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto me.</hi> But when he turned aſide from God, <hi>Sbimei</hi> one of his Servants curſeth him to his face, and his own Son <hi>Abſolom</hi> riſeth up in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When your Children carry themſelves undutifully or irreverently towards you, or do any thing that is ſinful and diſpleaſing to God, reprove them, and if Reproofs do not make them amend, correct them: This will make them give you reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>We have had Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits and live?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Avoid frowardneſs, intemperance, and all other vices, and carry your Souls in a holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and exemplary manner: for if you be addicted to any ſin, that will bring you under contempt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation, but ſin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any people.</hi> Yea, even ſuch as have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you formerly, and had you in high eſteem, if they come to underſtand that you are tainted with any Vice, they will be ready to deſpiſe you: <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Jeruſalem hath grievouſly finned, and therefore ſhe is removed: All that honoured her deſpiſe her, becauſe they have ſeen her nakedneſs.</hi> But by walking in an holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exemplary manner, you ſhall be reverenced not only by ſuch as are gracious themſelves, but by thoſe that are deſtitute of the grace of God: <hi>Herod</hi> was not a good man himſelf, our Saviour calleth him a Fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.23. becauſe he was a ſubtil and cruel Enemy to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31, 32. Yet <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt being an holy man, <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod feared John, knowing that be was a juſt man, and holy,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102523:77"/>and obſerved him:</hi> Prov. 22.4. <hi>By humility and the fear of the Lord, are Riches, and Honour, and Life.</hi> And as an holy Converſation will procure Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſo alſo it will preſerve the ſame; <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.16. <hi>A gracious woman retaineth honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Carry your ſelves wiſely and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the managing of your Family Affairs: for, <hi>A mans wiſdom maketh his face to ſhine,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.1. But fooliſh and indiſcreet carriage will cauſe us to be ſlighted and diſreſpected, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Dead flies cauſe the Ointment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour, ſo doth a little folly him that is in Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Wiſdom and Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Do not carry your ſelves lightly &amp; vainly in your Families, but let your deportment be grave and ſerious, that will be a means to keep your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants in due ſubjection, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>One that ruleth well his own Houſe, having his Children in ſubjection with all gravity.</hi> He cannot rule his Houſe well, that doth not keep his Children in ſubjection, for if the Children be unruly, the Servants will be ſo too; and a man ſhall hardly keep his Children in ſubjection, if his carriage be not grave and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Uſe not over-much familiarity or delicacy towards your Children and Servants, eſpecially when your Children are grown up to ſome maturity, for familiarity will be apt to breed contempt, and make Children and Servants to caſt off that awe and dread which they ought to bear towards their Parents and Maſters: Children are commanded not only to love, but to fear their Parents, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his mother and his father:</hi> And Servants are commanded to fear their Maſters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be obedient to them that are your Maſters according
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102523:78"/>to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart as unto Chriſt.</hi> Over-much familiarity will cauſe them to caſt off this fear: <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth us a caution againſt uſing too much delicacy towards our Servants, as that which will ſpoil them, and make them prove great Croſſes; <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.21. <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately bringeth up his Servant from a Child, ſhall have him become his Son at length.</hi> The vulgar Latin ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the words, <hi>Poſtea ſentiet eum contumacem;</hi> He ſhall find him to be ſtubborn and obſtinate. <hi>Pagnine</hi> renders the words, <hi>In noviſſimo crit ſuperbus perinde ac filius;</hi> He will become proud, and expect to be dealt with as if he were a Son, and not a Servant: When inſtead of that gravity and diſtance which ought to be in the carriage of Maſters and Parents, they will be ſo familiar as to play with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Children, this makes them to loſe their authority, according to the Proverb in uſe among the <hi>Arabians, Colluſio ſive jocus aufert reverentiam;</hi> Playing and Jeſting takes away a Mans Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: If we uſe to jeſt and ſport with our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Children, we muſt expect no more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence from them. And therefore the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> gives this Advice to Parents, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 30.9, 10. <hi>Cocker thy Child, and he ſhall make thee afraid; play with him, and he will bring thee to heavineſs; laugh not with him, leſt thou have ſorrow with him, and leſt thou gnaſh thy teeth in the end.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our carriage towards our Servants, in his Dialogue <hi>de legibus,</hi> gives this prudent Advice, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que jocus ullus, cum illis habeatur, quod multi ſtultè facientes, dum delicatius eos nutriunt, difficiliorem viam &amp; ſibi ad imperandum, &amp; illis ad obediendum reddunt.</hi> Do not uſe at any time to jeſt with your Servants, which thing many doing fooliſhly, do make it more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102523:78"/>difficult for themſelves to govern, and alſo more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for their Servants to obey, by their training them up delicately. Only here it will be needful to hint, that whilſt you labour to carry your ſelves with gravity, and to avoid too much familiarity, you had need be careful that you do not become mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe or auſtere, but rather endeavour to expreſs much ſweetneſs and candor in your carriage towards your Children and Servants. There was laid up in the Ark <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and the Pot with <hi>Manna,</hi> and the Tables of the Covenant: <hi>Greg. mag.</hi> hath an obſervation hereupon to this effect, <hi>He that would govern well, muſt be furniſhed with the knowledge of the Scriptures, and muſt make uſe of the Rod of Correction, yet ſo, as there muſt be the ſweetneſs of Manna with it.</hi> We ſhould labour if it be poſſible to win our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by love to obſerve the Commandments of God, but if they will not be drawn with Manna, then we muſt make uſe of <hi>Aron</hi>'s Rod, and when we are neceſſitated to uſe ſeverity, it muſt be tempered with mercy.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>10</label> IT will conduce much to the rendring of this work of Family-Inſtruction ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, ſo to carry your ſelves as that you may have the love, and gain the affections of thoſe that are under your charge: for if our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do not only fear and reverence us, but alſo love us, the Inſtructions that we give them will be the better accepted, and make the deeper impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knowing <hi>Philemon</hi> lov'd him, was confident he would follow the counſel he gave him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 7.21. <hi>We have great joy—in thy love,—having confidence in thy obedience,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102523:79"/>The like confidence he had of the <hi>Theſſ alonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>We have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the thing which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi> And they were ſuch as bore a great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. If there be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to the perſon that inſtructs, his Doctrine will do little good. <hi>Ahab</hi> hating <hi>Micaiah,</hi> received no good by his Prophecies, but went on in his own way, contrary to the good counſel of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> whereby he brought deſtruction upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, <hi>How ſhould we ſo carry our ſelves as to get the Love and Affection of our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Shew your ſelves loving to them. Love will draw love from the worſt of men, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners alſo love thoſe that love them.</hi> Shew your love to them by ſpeaking kindly to them, and by ſeeking their welfare: Hereby <hi>Mordecai</hi> got the love of the Jews, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Mordecai the Jew was—accepted of the multitude of his Brethren, ſeeking the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be kind to them, as you ſee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; give them ſome gifts to encourage them to learn thoſe things that are for their good: this will win much upon their affections: <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Every man is a friend to him that giveth Gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Give ear to their juſt Complaints, and be willing to redreſs their grievances. <hi>Job</hi> was ready to hear the cauſe and complaint of the meaneſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his family, even when and wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102523:79"/>was concerned; <hi>Job</hi> 31.13, 14. <hi>If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my man Servant, or of my maid Servant, when they contended with me; what then ſhall I do when God riſeth up? And when he viſiteth, what ſhall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him?</hi> And who was more loved and reſpected than <hi>Job? Job</hi> 29.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Abſolom</hi> by his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous carriage and kind ſpeeches, and by expreſſing his readineſs to redreſs the grievances of the people, ſtole the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 15.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> with a deſire to redreſs their grievances, his wiſe men counſelled him to anſwer their deſires, for thereby he ſhould engage their affections to him for ever, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.7. <hi>If thou be kind to this people, and pleaſe them, and ſpeak good words unto them, they will be thy Servants for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Anſwer their Requeſts, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire thoſe things that are for their good, and which may conveniently be granted them. As Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering our Requeſts makes us love God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord becauſe he hath heard the voice of my Supplications:</hi> So our anſwering thoſe Requeſts which our Children or Servants make to us, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to love us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Cover their failings and infirmities. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.9. <hi>He that covereth a tranſgreſſion ſeeketh love;</hi> or (as it is in the Margent) <hi>procureth love:</hi> By covering a cranſgreſſion, is not meant that we ſhould forbear reproving them: for Reproof prudently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, will not hinder, but increaſe love: <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Rebuke a wiſe man, and he will love thee:</hi> But by covering a tranſgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſon, is meant, 1. That we ſhould not twit and upbraid them with their faults, and be often repeating them, as the manner of ſome is, eſpecially when they are in a paſſion, for this is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102523:80"/>great hindrance of love, and cauſeth diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween inward Friends, as appears by the following words; <hi>But he that repeateth a matter ſeparateth very friends.</hi> 2. That we ſhould not divulge or blaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad their infirmities, but endeavour to conceal them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>11</label> IF you would ſave the Souls of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants by thoſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you give them out of the word of God, endeavour to ingraft thoſe Truths which you teach them, in their hearts: for if the Word of God be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in their hearts, it will be a powerful means of ſaving their Souls, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the engrafted word, which is able to ſave your Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ſay, <hi>What ſhall we do that we may get the word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in their hearts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Acquaint them with Gods Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath promiſed to engrave or write his word in their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> And ſtir them up to plead this Covenant, until they find that God according to his promiſe, hath engraven his Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:102523:80"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Cauſe them to underſtand thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which you teach them; and to that end, when there is any difficulty therein explain them, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to beget in them a clear and right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of God. When the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is enlightned with the knowledge of Divine Truths, there is way made for their entrance into and their abode in the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Wiſdom reſteth in the heart of him that hath underſtanding.</hi>—By wiſdom we may underſtand the grace of God, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>The fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom.</hi> Now the grace of God doth not only enter into, but reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and maketh its abode in the heart of him that hath underſtanding. If your Inſtructions be never ſo good, though they be drawn out of the word of God, yet if they be not underſtood, they will not abide in their hearts whom you inſtruct, but will quickly vaniſh out of their minds, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. <hi>When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away that which was ſown in his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Endeavour to fix the word of God in their memories, cauſe them often to rehearſe what you have taught them, exhort them to meditate and ponder upon thoſe Inſtructions they have received from you: This will be a means of ingrafting the <hi>word of God</hi> in their hearts. As the remembring of our ſins is a means of engraving our iniquities upon our hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>The ſin of Judah is written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond, it is graven upon the Table of their Hearts, and upon the Horns of their Altars, whilſt their Children remember their Altars and their Groves:</hi> So remembring and pondering upon the Word of God, will be a means of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or writing the Word of God upon our hearts.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102523:81"/>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.1, 3. <hi>My Son forget not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Commandments—Bind them about thy Neck, write them upon the Table of thine Heart:</hi> The binding of the Commandments about the Neck—is the ſame with not forgetting the Law, mentioned verſ. 1. This binding of the Law about the Neck, was uſed by the Jews as a Memorial to help them to keep the Commandments of God in remembrance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.9. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> joyning theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Bind them about thy Neck, write them upon the Table of thine Heart;</hi> implies that the binding of the Commandments about our Neck, that is, the keeping them in remembrance, will be a means to write them upon our Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Inure them to godly Diſcourſe. When they are in your preſence, ſpeak often to them of the word of God; and when they are diſcourſing one with another, exhort them to diſcourſe of what you have taught them out of the word of God. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing out of the word will be a means of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing the Law of God upon their hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the Righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment:</hi> And what is the fruit and effect of this good diſcourſe, is declared in the next words, <hi>The Law of his God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Bring them in love with the word of God; love to the Word will root and ground the Truths of God in their hearts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Rooted and grounded in love.</hi> Love to the word of God will root it ſo deeply and firmly in their hearts, that no troubles will cauſe them to depart from the word of God, but they will ſtick and cleave to it unto their dying day: <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Love is ſtrong as death,— many Waters cannot quench Love, neither can the Floods drown it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:102523:81"/>
                  <p>If you ask, <hi>How ſhall we bring our Children and Servants to love the Word of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer:
<list>
                        <item>1. Shew them the purity, excellency, and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs that is in the word of God; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. <hi>Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Stir them up to practiſe the word of God, that will cauſe them to love it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.167. <hi>My Soul hath kept thy Teſtimonies, and I love them exceedingly.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. Shew them what a dangerous thing it is, not to love the word. God is wont to ſend down ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them that do not receive his Truth in the love of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10.11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Exhort them to put away and hate their ſins, and then they will love and delight in the word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.163. <hi>I hate and abhor lying, but thy Law do I love.</hi>

Yea ſweeter than Honey to my month; therefore I love thy Commandments above Gold, yea above fine Gold.</hi>

Whatever Inſtructions you give your Families, if you leave them Chriſtleſs, you leave them in a miſerable periſhing condition: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> But if you can prevail with them to come to and to cloſe with JESUS CHRIST, they ſhall become the Children of God, and ſhall aſſuredly obtain everlaſting Life: <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name:</hi> 1 John 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life:</hi> John 6.47. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlaſting Life.</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Shew them their miſerable loſt and undone condition without Chriſt. The miſery of Man without Chriſt, is ſet out by the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That at that time ye were without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the world.</hi> In this Text the miſery of ſuch
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102523:82"/>as are without Chriſt, is ſet forth ſeveral ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. They are Aliens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that is, they are none of the People of God.</item>
                        <item>2. They are Strangers from the Covenants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; that is, they have no part or portion in any of the promiſes either of the firſt or ſecond Covenant, the Covenant of Works, or the Covenant of Grace.</item>
                        <item>3. They are without hope; They have no hope of mercy either in this world, or in the world to come: They may have much preſumption, and much carnal ſecurity, but they have no hope.</item>
                        <item>4. They are without God; that is, without the love and favour of God, without the grace of God, without any communion with and enjoyment of God. There is much alſo ſaid in few words towards the ſetting forth of the miſery of a man that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, in that fore-mentioned Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> He hath not the Life of Grace here, but is dead in his ſins; he hath not the Life of Glory hereafter, but is debarred of all hope of entring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven for ever. The conviction of their miſery and periſhing condition without Chriſt, will draw them to ſeek after Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18. <hi>I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger, I will ariſe and go to my Father:</hi> Mat. 8.25. <hi>His Diſciples came to him,—ſaying, Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi> Inform them alſo that ſalvation from their miſerable periſhing condition, is to be had in Chriſt, and no where elſe but in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ſalvation in any other: for there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby they may be ſaved.</hi> When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw that ſalvation was to be had in the Lord, and no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102523:83"/>where elſe, this cauſed them to come to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God; truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Acquaint them with the amiableneſs and excellency of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they ſhall receive from him, if they embrace him, as namely, that all their ſins ſhall be pardoned, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. and their Souls ſhall be taken into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. and they ſhall be bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. and that they ſhall have all the bleſſings of Heaven for ever, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. When the Spouſe had ſet forth Chriſts excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, that he was the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely, <hi>&amp;c. Cant.</hi> 5.10, 16. They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaw no beauty or comelineſs in him why they ſhould deſire him, verſ 9. <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved?</hi> &amp;c. fell in love with Chriſt, and began to enquire where they might find him, and how they might come to enjoy him; Chap. 6.1. <hi>Whether is thy Beloved gone, O thou faireſt among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether is thy beloved turned aſide, that we may ſeek him with thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Cauſe them to underſtand that God is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to beſtow his Son, and Jeſus Chriſt is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to beſtow himſelf upon all thoſe that feel their need of him, and are willing to receive him; as is evident from ſuch Scriptures as theſe: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth ſay, Come; and let him that is athirſt come; and whoſoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely:</hi> Iſa. 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea come and buy wine and milk without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102523:83"/>price:</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink:</hi> John 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> The underſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts love, how willing and ready he is to receive ſuch as come to him, will be a powerful means to draw their Souls to Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>With loving kindneſs have I drawn thee:</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a man, with the bands of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Inform them what Jeſus Chriſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from thoſe that come to him, and cloſe with him, if they would be owned by him for true Diſciples, and ſuch as ſhall partake of his ſaving benefits: As,
<list>
                        <item>1. They muſt abandon all their ſins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. They muſt deny themſelves, and take up their Croſs, and follow Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me:</hi> Luke 14.27. <hi>Whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. They muſt love and prefer Chriſt above all their Relations, and whatſoever elſe is dear to them in the whole world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. They muſt take his yoke upon them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Government, and obey his Commands; <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you ſhall find reſt unto your Souls:</hi> John 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments:</hi> John 15.14. <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:102523:84"/>
                        <item>5. They muſt continue believing in Chriſt, and walking in his ways as long as they live, <hi>John</hi> 8.31. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto thoſe Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my words, then are ye my Diſciples indeed.</hi> Let them know alſo that the Lord Jeſus doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they ſhould do theſe things in their own ſtrength; but that if they look up unto him, he will give them his holy Spirit to enable them to do all theſe things, and whatſoever elſe he requireth of them: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Fortifie them againſt the Offence and Scandal of the Croſs of Chriſt, that they may not revolt and depart from Chriſt after they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, when they ſhall meet with troubles and perſecutions for the Goſpels ſake, as many are apt to do; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. <hi>Yet hath he not Root in himſelf, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, <hi>How ſhall we fortifie our Families againſt the offence of the Croſs, that when troubles ariſe for the Goſpels ſake, they may not fall off from the ways of</hi> CHRIST?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Tell them at their entrance into Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity what they muſt expect to meet withal, if they will be Chriſtians indeed. Let them know they ſhall be hated in the world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Luke 21.12. <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake,</hi> and muſt look for Reproaches, Confiſcation of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102523:84"/>Goods, Impriſonment, and all ſorts of perſecution. This was the means that Chriſt uſed to keep his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from being offended at the troubles ſhould come upon them: He told them before hand what they muſt expect to meet with, <hi>John</hi> 16.1, 2. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> As it is with thoſe that build an Houſe or a Tower, they ſhould firſt ſit down and conſider what will be the coſt and charges that they muſt be at in building, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 29, 30. <hi>Which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt, whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it? Leſt haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it begin to mock him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This man began to build, and was not able to finiſh.</hi> So they who have a purpoſe to become Chriſtians, had need count what it may coſt them to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed; they muſt count upon it, that for ought they know, it may coſt them the loſs of all things, even of their Lives, and ſee whether they are willing to become Chriſtians on theſe terms, leſt after they are entred into the ways of Chriſt, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them when they meet with perſecutions for the Goſpels ſake, and ſo become a reproach and and ſcandal to Religion.</p>
                  <p>2. Inform them that unleſs they be willing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſuffer the loſs of all things for Chriſt, when they are called to it, they cannot be the Diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> And if they go about to ſave their Lives, when the Lord Jeſus calleth them to lay them down, they ſhall loſe eternal Life: <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102523:85"/>ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and the Goſpels, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That they may not be diſcouraged from embracing the Lord Jeſus, and the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion becauſe of thoſe ſufferings that they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with in the profeſſion and practiſe of the ways of Chriſt, propoſe to them ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may encourage them to embrace the Croſs of Chriſt with chearfulneſs: As,
<list>
                        <item>1. Whatſoever loſſes they ſuſtain on the Account of Chriſt or his Goſpel, ſhall be made up to them with an hundred-fold advantage in this life, and if not in the ſame kind, yet in ſome other thing which is as good or better, beſides the recompence that they ſhall have in the world to come, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, There is no man that hath left Houſe, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my ſake and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this time, Houſes, and Brethren and Siſters, and Mothers, and Children, and Lands, with perſecution, and in the world to come life everlaſting.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The ſufferings of this preſent life will increaſe our glory in the world to come: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> The glory of Heaven doth ſo far exceed the ſufferings of this preſent life, that they are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>For I reckon that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.—</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. It is our happineſs and not our miſery, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Reproaches and perſecutions for Chriſts ſake, and it ſhould fill us with joy, rather than caſt us down with ſorrow, when we meet with any ſufferings for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102523:85"/>Righteouſneſs ſake: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Bleſſed are ye, when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſpeak all manner of evil againſt you falſely, for my ſake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven:</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13, 14. <hi>Rejoyce inaſmuch as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings; that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy: If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of God and of Glory reſteth upon you.</hi> There is a greater excellency in ſuffering for Chriſt, than in enjoying all the riches of the world, and it is far more eligible to endure the ſharpeſt afflictions, than to enjoy the delights and pleaſures of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of GOD, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the Reproaches of Chriſt</hi> (even thoſe things that are moſt hard to be born) <hi>greater Riches than the Treaſures of Egypt,</hi> or all the enjoyments in the World.</item>
                        <item>4. God will not ſuffer any man to be afflicted for Chriſt or the Goſpels ſake, above what he will enable him to bear: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is Faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but will alſo with the Temptation make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> And when we do ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, the Lord will be with us in all our ſufferings: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not in deſpair:</hi> Iſaiah 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Waters, I will be with thee:</hi> Pſalm 91.15. <hi>I will be with him in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:102523:86"/>
                        <item>5. The more we ſuffer for Chriſt, the more abundant conſolation we ſhall have from Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt;</hi> And we ſhall find more delight in our Conſolations, than we do grief in our ſufferings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. <hi>In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my ſoul.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Put them in mind of the great things which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered for them: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor for our ſakes, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.9. <hi>He gave his Body to be broken for us, he made his Soul an offering for our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. The conſideration of what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, and how willingly he ſuffered for us (<hi>I gave my Back to the ſmiters, and my Cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting,</hi> Iſa. 50.6.) will make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer for him, and keep us from fainting under our Sufferings: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Looking unto</hi> JESUS, <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God: for conſider him that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt you be wearied, and faint in your minds.</hi>

The Lord doth not only command us to teach our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the Scriptures, but he requireth us to do this work with diligence: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children</hi>—This work is a good work, and every good work muſt be followed with diligence: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If ſhe have followed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently every good work:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh there of Widows; now if Widows, whoſe condition is oft attended with many difficulties and incumbrances, muſt follow every good work with diligence, how much more are they who have greater abilities and opportunities for doing good works, than deſolate
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102523:94"/>Widows, obliged to be diligent therein. We read of <hi>David,</hi> that when he prepared Materials to build the Temple, he did it with all his might; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.2. <hi>I have prepared with all my might for the Houſe of my God, the Gold for things to be made of Gold, and Silver for things of Silver.</hi>—The building up of our Children and Servants a ſpiritual Houſe for the Lord, is as great and acceptable a work as the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the material Temple, and thefore we ſhould ſet upon it with all our might. To quicken your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence herein, conſider</p>
                  <p>1. You know not how ſhort a time you have to live with your Families, and you can do nothing for them when you are in the Grave; and therefore what you ſee neceſſary to be done for them by way of inſtruction before you die, do it with all your might; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither thou goeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To ſet your hearts to this work, and do it with your might, is the way to proſper in what you take in hand; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.21. <hi>In every work that he began in the ſervice of the Houſe of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandments, to ſeek his God, he did it with all his heart, and proſpered.</hi>

                  <p>4. This work is to be done out of love to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 21.15. <hi>Loveſt thou me?

                  <p>5. Conſider how diligent Satan and wicked men are to do evil, and to draw others to ſin. Some wicked men are ſo eager of doing miſchief, that they cannot ſleep in the night, if they have done no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the day time: <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.16. <hi>They ſleep not except they have done miſchief, and their ſleep is taken away unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall.

After there is ſome good work wrought in their hearts, they will be in danger of falling into an hardned frame of Spirit, if we do not with great diligence inſtruct and exhort them to ſhun that which is evil, and to follow after holineſs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Take heed Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God: but exhort one another daily, whilſt it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>

As Miniſters, ſo alſo Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, muſt take heed to all their Flock, and not only to the principal Members thereof: <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the Flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To provoke you to be careful of every Member of your Family, even of the meaneſt Servant and Apprentice, as well as of your Children, and to ſeek after the Converſion, Edification, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every one that the Lord hath committed to your Charge and Care: Conſider,</p>
                  <p>1. The Example of Chriſt; He was careful not to loſe one of thoſe Souls that were committed to him by his Father: <hi>John</hi> 17.12. <hi>While I was with them in the World, I kept them in thy Name: Thoſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept; and none of them is loſt but the Son of Perdition.</hi> It is true, <hi>Judas</hi> the Son of Perdition was loſt, but not through the want of Chriſts care, for <hi>Judas</hi> was inſtructed as well as the reſt, but through his own wicked and perverſe ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>2. The neglecting of any one perſon in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, may trouble and pollute the whole Family, and prove a very great hindrance to the good of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102523:95"/>Family, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.18. <hi>One ſinner deſtroyeth much good.</hi> Heb. 12.15. <hi>Looking diligently leſt any man fail of the Grace of God, leſt any Root of bitterneſs ſpringing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The Soul of the meaneſt Servant is of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than the whole world: <hi>Mar.</hi> 8, 36. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be minded and regarded above all worldly things.</p>
                  <p>4. God is ſo careful of that which we commit to his keeping, that he will loſe or neglect nothing that we commit to him. After we have committed our ſelves to God, he doth not only look after our perſons, but after every hair of our heads: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.30. <hi>The very hairs of your head are all numbred: Luc.</hi> 21.17, 18. <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake, but there ſhall not a hair of your head periſh.</hi> And ſhall we neglect any of thoſe immortal Souls which the Lord hath committed to our keeping, when God is ſo careful of us, as to look after every hair of our heads?</p>
                  <p>5. The pooreſt and meaneſt perſons in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that have the loweſt employment and weakeſt parts, may belong to the Election of Grace as well as thoſe that are of a higher degree; 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> And ſhall we think much to ſpend a little time and care for the ſaving of their Souls whom the great God hath made Objects of his Love and Care from all Eternity? We find that God looks after ſimple as well as wiſe men; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.6. <hi>The Lord preſerveth the ſimple</hi>—And ſhall we think much to look after thoſe of whom the Lord himſelf taketh care?</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:102523:96"/>
                  <p>6. It is the will of God that means ſhould be uſed for the ſaving of every mans Soul; that the leaſt as well as the greateſt, the young as well as the old, ſhould be brought to repentance, that ſo they may obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.14. <hi>It is not the will of your Father which is in Heaven that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh:</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, (as ſome men count ſlackneſs) but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. If any man have an hundred ſheep, and but one of them go aſtray, he doth not ſay, I have nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nine remaining with me, I will not trouble my ſelf to ſeek up that one ſheep that is gone from me; but he looks up his loſt ſheep, though it be but one, till he find it: <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.4. <hi>What man of you having an hundred ſheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the Wilderneſs, and go after that which is loſt until he find it.</hi> One man is of more value than all the ſheep in the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.12. <hi>How much then is a man better than a ſheep?</hi> Suppoſe a man hath in his Family an hundred perſons, and ninety and nine of them ſhould be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and but one ſhould go aſtray, he ſhould not reſt ſatisfied that he hath ninety and nine in his Family truly gracious, ſo as to neglect that perſon that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aſtray, but ſhould uſe all diligence for the converting and ſaving of that one Soul that as yet remains in a ſinful periſhing Condition. And what I have ſaid of extending your Care and Diligence unto every Member of your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is to be underſtood as well of thoſe that ſojourn with you for a ſhorter Time, as of thoſe that do dwell conſtantly with you, For
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102523:96"/>as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, in another caſe, <hi>Numbers</hi> 15.16. <hi>One Law and one Manner ſhall be for you, and for the Stranger that ſojourneth with you.</hi> The like may I ſay here, You ſhould take one and the ſame care as well for them that ſojourn with you, whilſt they are with you, as for thoſe that are conſtantly with you. It may be the Lord ſent them under your Roof for a ſeaſon, that you might inſtil thoſe things into them that may do them good for ever.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, <hi>What ſhould we do to prevent diſcord and contention, and to preſerve love and peace in our Families?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>1. Inſtruct them out of the word of God what a great evil it is to live in ſtrife and variance, that ſo they may fear this as well as other ſins. Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, are accounted amongſt the works of the Fleſh, and do as certainly exclude men from the Kingdom of Heaven, as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery, Idolatry, or any other ſins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. To ſow diſcord among Brethren, is reckoned up amongſt thoſe ſix things which the Lord hateth, and the ſeven things which are an abomination to him; <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 19. Diſcord and ſtrife are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Nature, who is a God of Love and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102523:97"/>Peace, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.</p>
                  <p>2. Adviſe them to take heed of the occaſions and beginnings of ſtrife; and therefore when they feel any motions to ſtrife or wrath, ariſing in their hearts, let them ſtifle thoſe motions, before they break out into action; for wrath and ſtrife are more eaſily kept down, than appeaſed after they are ſtirred up: <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginnings of ſtrife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention before it be medled with:</hi> Prov. 18.19. <hi>A Brother offended is harder to be won than a ſtrong City, and their Contentions are like the bars of a Caſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Counſel them to be of an humble lowly ſpirit, to think and eſteem better of others than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This will prevent their contending one with another: <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Only by pride cometh contention.</hi> Prov. 28.25. <hi>He that is of a proud heart ſtirreth up ſtrife:</hi> Phil. 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain glory:</hi> How ſhall we attain to this, to do nothing through ſtrife? The following words will reſolve you; <hi>But in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Exhort them to abſtain from all provoking ſpeeches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Grievous words ſtir up anger;</hi> and from all provoking carriages one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſcorning each other: Prov. 22.10. <hi>Caſt out the ſcorner; and contention ſhall go out, yea ſtrife and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhall ceaſe.</hi> A froward carriage that alſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſtrife. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.18. <hi>A wrathful man ſtirreth up ſtrife, but he that is ſlow to anger appeaſeth ſtrife.</hi> Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing is another evil that occaſions much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and contention: <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Where no need is, there the fire goeth out; ſo where there is no Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, the ſtrife ceaſeth.</hi> Thoſe perſons that do not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102523:98"/>learn to bridle their tongues, they will ſet the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies where they live at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and alſo with other Families, and not Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies only, but kingdoms alſo; <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The tongue is a fire. — A world of iniquity —and ſetteth on fire the courſe of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Teach them to bear one with another, let the ſtronger bear with the weak; and when any ones paſſion is ſtirred, let the other ſeek to appeaſe it by mild ſpeeches and gentle carriage. It is not good to anſwer paſſion with paſſion, that will blow up the fire to a greater flame. But if either the Husband or Wife be angry, or one Servant be angry with his fellow-Servant, the way to aſſwage anger is to ſpeak in a mild gentle manner to the perſon that is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. <hi>A ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath, but grievous words ſtir up anger:</hi> Prov. 25.15. <hi>By long forbearing, a Prince is perſwaded, and a ſoft tongue breaketh the bone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Admoniſh them to be of a ſelf-denying yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, and not to be ſtiff, and ſelf-willed, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Yielding pacifieth great offences:</hi> By this means <hi>Abraham</hi> prevented the ſtrife that was like to have been between him and <hi>Lot,</hi> by receding from his own Right, and yielding to <hi>Lot,</hi> who was the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to make his choice which way be would go with his Flocks and Herds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>7. When any ſtrife or contention doth ariſe, take up the difference that is between one party and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and endeavour to reconcile each to other, and judge with equity and impartiality between him that doth, and him that ſuffereth the wrong. Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when he ſaw two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtriving together, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring them to an agreement, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.26. This is a bleſſed work to make peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102523:98"/>though it be attended with ſome difficulties, we ſhould endeavour, as much as in us lieth, to make peace between ſuch as are at variance one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102523:99"/>this work, ſo our ſucceſs in it is from God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Paul</hi> was an able Miniſter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and <hi>Apollo</hi> was an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.24. yet neither <hi>Paul</hi>'s Abilities, nor <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Eloquence could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or edifie any, but where God gave a bleſſing to their Labours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider how the Servants of Chriſt who have been Teachers of others, have longed and laboured with God in prayer night and day, for the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, edification and ſalvation of thoſe that have been committed to their Care and Charge: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8. <hi>God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle had a longing deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſanctification and ſalvation of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians;</hi> He did not only long, but longed <hi>greatly,</hi> not after ſome, or moſt of them, but after them <hi>all,</hi> and that in the <hi>bowels of Chriſt;</hi> that is, with ſuch earneſt and ardent deſires as Jeſus Chriſt hath towards the converſion of Sinners, and their eternal ſalvation; or, <hi>In the Bowels of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> may ſignifie thoſe bowels, that tender and ardent affection which Jeſus Chriſt had implanted in his ſoul: And what was it that the Apoſtle did thus long for on their behalf? It was, <hi>that their love might abound more and more, in knowledge, and in all judgment, that they might approve the things that are excellent, that they might be ſincere and without offence till the day of Chriſt, that they might be filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſs which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God,</hi> ver. 9.10, 11. How earneſtly did the Apoſtle thirſt after the converſion of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> Gal. 4.9. <hi>My little Children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> As it is with a travailing woman, ſhe is full of ſorrow and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102523:99"/>heavineſs, and cries out, and is pained, till ſhe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: <hi>John</hi> 16.21. <hi>A woman when ſhe is in travail hath ſorrow:</hi> Rev. 12.2. <hi>She being with Child cried, travelling in Birth, and pained to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> So it was with the Apoſtle, he wept, he cried out, he was pained, he could not be at eaſe untill Chriſt was formed in their hearts. This is a good pattern for Parents to follow, as ſoon as God hath given them Children, they ſhould travel in birth again, till Chriſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their Childrens hearts. The Apoſtle was ſo affectionately deſirous of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> welfare, that he could have imparted his own Soul to them: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>We were gentle among you, even as a Nurſe cheriſheth her Children, ſo being affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you not the Goſpel of God only, but alſo our own Souls, becauſe ye were dear unto us.</hi> And as the Apoſtle did earneſtly long after their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare whom he inſtructed, ſo he prayed exceedingly for them night and day; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might ſee your face, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that which is lacking in your Faith:</hi> Phil. 1.4. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in every prayer of mine making requeſt for you all with Joy:</hi> He put up no prayer at any time, but he remembred them all; and it was not irkſome to him ſo to do, but he did it with Joy.</p>
                  <p>And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo alſo others of the Servants of Chriſt have been wont to labour and ſtrive mightily with God in Prayer for thoſe whom they have taught and inſtructed in the ways of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Epaphras, who is one of you, a Servant of Chriſt, ſaluteth you, always la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may ſtand perfect and compleat in the whole Will of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102523:100"/>He did not only pray, but laboured in prayer, and that fervently, not ſometimes, but always; and that not for his own concernments, but for you: beſides, it is not ſaid in prayer, but in prayers; intimating that he put up a multitude of prayers for them; and it was no ſmall meaſure of grace that he laboured thus earneſtly for on their behalf, but that they might ſtand perfect and compleat in the will, in all the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prayer will do great things with God for others, as well as our own Souls; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Pray one for another that ye may be healed; the effectual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> By praying in faith, and with fervency, we may obtain converting grace, remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life, for our Children and Servants, and others, as well as thoſe of our own Families, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death.</hi> This promiſe may give us great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to pray in faith for the converſion and ſalvation of ſuch as are viſible and open ſinners. <hi>If any ſee his Brother ſin,</hi> &amp;c. If we conſider,</p>
                  <p>1. The perſons to whom this promiſe is made, and they are every one that believeth in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt: It is not a priviledge that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the Apoſtles, or extraordinary men of God; but it is ſaid, <hi>If any man</hi>—that is, any man that believeth in Chriſt, as appeareth from the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The perſons for whom Believers may obtain Life and Salvation upon praving to God for them, and they are his Brethren, ſinning Brethren, <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin,—he ſhall give him life for them</hi>— He firſt ſpeaks of a Brother in the ſingular number,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102523:100"/>and then ſaith, <hi>Life for them,</hi> in the plural, which ſhews that the word <hi>Brother</hi> is to be taken collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as <hi>Beza</hi> obſerves) for all or any Brother for whom a Believer ſhall pray to God. If you ask, Who is meant by a Brother? I anſwer: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeemeth to uſe the word <hi>Brother</hi> in this Epiſtle in the ſame latitude with <hi>Neighbour,</hi> which may be proved from ſeveral paſſages in his Epiſtle, as Chap. iii. 14, 15, 16. Chap. iv. 20.21. And <hi>Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> expounds the word Brother, <hi>Fratris nomine intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit proximum, qui eandem nobiſcum fidem ac proinde eundem in coelis patrem profitetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. He excepts no ſins but the ſin unto death; that is, as moſt expound the place, the ſin againſt the Holy Gaoſt, which is a ſin that ſhall never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſ: As for any other ſins, if Believers ask of God Repentance and Forgiveneſs of ſins for them that have ſinned, that ſo they may have Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, God will grant them their deſire.</p>
                  <p>Another Scripture that ſheweth the efficacy of prayer, in order to the obtaining for others forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and Grace whereby they may be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to receive forgiveneſs of ſins, we have <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him. Iſhmael</hi> was a wild Child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.11, 12. yet when <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>O that Iſhmael might live before thee!</hi> God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him, verſe 20. <hi>As for Iſhmael I have heard thee:</hi> And though the Lord adds afterward, <hi>But my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will I eſtabliſh with Iſaac;</hi> Yet this, as <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerves, ſeems rather to be an excluding of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>'s Poſterity, than his Perſon, from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; unto whom, the ſame day that <hi>God</hi> gave him this anſwer, <hi>Abraham</hi> adminiſters <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102523:101"/>Seal of the Covenant. When the woman of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Daughter was grievouſly vexed with a Devil, her prayer prevailed with Chriſt to deliver her Daughter from the power of the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, 28.</p>
                  <p>Objection.</p>
                  <p>I have prayed often to God to give my Children Grace, and to convert and turn them from their ſins; but I do not ſee that my Prayers avail any thing with God for my Children, they abide ſtill in a graceleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. Do you inſtruct them diligently, as well as pray for them? Do you watch over them? Do you ſhew them a good example? Do you reprove them? Do you give them due correction? If you do not uſe other means as well as prayer, poſſibly that is the reaſon why your prayers avail not for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who earneſtly deſired and prayed for the ſalvation of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved;</hi> joyned with his prayers the uſe of all means to effect their ſalvation; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.14. <hi>If by any means I might provoke to emulation them which are my fleſh, and might ſave ſome of them.</hi> So muſt we joyn the uſe of all other means with prayer, if we would have our prayers become effectual for the converſion and ſalvation of our Children.</p>
                  <p>2. Though we ſee no preſent return of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet we ſhould continue praying, and not faint or be diſcouraged, until we have obtained what we pray for: <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. <hi>He ſpake a Parable unto them, to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi> Though the Lord may be ſilent for a ſeaſon, and ſeem not to regard our Prayers, to try our Faith
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102523:101"/>and Patience, yet he may purpoſe to give us all that we pray for. He dealt thus with the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when ſhe came to him with a Requeſt on the behalf of her Daughter; at the firſt <hi>he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her not a word,</hi> Matth. 15.23. And when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples intercede for her, he ſeems to diſcourage them from making any farther requeſt for her, by ſaying to them, ver. 24. <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael;</hi> and afterward, when ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to cry after him, he ſeemeth to beat her off, and reject her prayer, by telling her, Verſe 26. <hi>It is not meet to take the Childrens Bread, and caſt it to Dogs:</hi> Yet ſhe ſtill holding on her ſuit, at length Chriſt yields her the whole deſire of her heart, Verſe 28. <hi>Then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, O Woman, great is thy Faith; Be it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee even as thou wilt: And her Daughter was made whole from that very hour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If God ſhould not anſwer our Prayers for our Children whilſt we live, yet he may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe Prayers after we are dead, which we did offer up to him whilſt we lived with them. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Jews, that were ſo vile and wicked as to put him to death, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> And as an anſwer of Chriſts Prayer, thouſands of thoſe Jews that were not wrought upon either by Chriſts Doctrine, or Miracles, or Godly Life, but continued in an impenitent condition till after his death; yea, were ſo hardened as to have an hand in the crucifying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Life and Glory, were notwithſtanding converted by the preaching of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2, 23.37, 41.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102523:102"/>Suppoſe neither your Inſtructions, nor godly Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor Prayers ſhould prevail for the converſion of your Children whilſt you live, but they ſhould be vile, and ſtubborn, and diſobedient to God and to you, unto your dying day; yet ceaſe not praying for them: It may be the Lord will anſwer your prayers by making uſe of others to convert them, when you are laid in your Graves.</p>
                  <p>4. We ſhould ſin againſt God, if we ſhould ceaſe praying for our Children, becauſe we ſee no effect of our Prayers, but do behold much ſtubborneſs and perverſneſs in them. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a perverſe people, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaw little fruit of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or Prayers on their behalf, they were ſet upon their own way, and he could not diſſwade them from deſiring a change of Government, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therein they did not only reject <hi>Samuel,</hi> but God himſelf, from raigning over them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7, 8. yet he would not ceaſe from praying for them, leſt he ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Moreover as for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you.</hi> If <hi>Samuel</hi> was afraid to ceaſe praying for a ſtubborn perverſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leſt he ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, ought not Parents to continue praying for their graceleſs and diſobedient Children, for fear if they ſhould ceaſe to pray for them, they alſo ſhould ſin againſt the Lord?</p>
                  <p>5. If you have prayed for your Childrens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and cannot prevail, joyn faſting with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Sometimes mercies cannot be obtained from God, unleſs we faſt as well as pray, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.29. <hi>This kind can come forth by nothing but by Prayer and Faſting.</hi> If we have a Child that is ſick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, we do not ſtick at ſeeking God by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102523:102"/>Faſting and Prayer for its Recovery: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.15, 16. <hi>The Lord ſtruck the Child that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah's wife bare unto David, and it was very ſick; David therefore beſought God for the Child, and David faſted.</hi>— And ſhall we not much more ſeek to God by faſting and prayer, to recover our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants from the power of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and to deliver them from everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? This duty of Faſting, rightly performed, is of great uſe, both for the obtaining direction from God in the management of our undertakings, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21, 23. <hi>I proclaimed a Faſt—that we might afflict our ſelves before our God, to ſeek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for our ſubſtance, ſo we faſted, and beſought our God for this, and he was intreated of us.</hi> And alſo for procuring of ſucceſs in what we take in hand, as we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Eſther, Nehemiah,</hi> and ſeveral others, who ſetting upon their undertakings with faſting and prayer, proſperouſly effected what they took in hand, though their work was very great, and attended with very great difficulties. God ſeldom lets any Faſt, that is performed in a right manner, go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remarkable Reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.17, 18. And therefore it will be very much for our own and our Families advantage, to ſet apart ſome days of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, with our Families, to ſeek God by faſting and prayer to bleſs and ſucceed us in this Work of Family-Inſtruction.</p>

                        <item>1. God hath promiſed not only to be a God to his People, but alſo the God of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1. <hi>At the ſame time, ſaith the Lord, will I be the God of all the Families of Iſrael, and they ſhall be my People.</hi>

                  <p>Now that we may underſtand what is couched under this phraſe, <hi>Thy Wife ſhall be as a fruitful Vine:</hi> Let us conſider what the Scripture ſaith of the Vine in other places:</p>
                  <p>The Vine brings forth Wine, which cheareth God and men, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.13.</p>
                  <p>It caſteth forth a pleaſant delightful ſmell, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>To dwell under a Vine, implies ſafety and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, 1 <hi>King</hi> 4.25. Alſo a dwelling in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wars, Jars, and Contentions, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.34.</p>
                  <p>The Vine hath no prickles on it, or any thing that may hurt a man, and is oppoſed to the pricking Briar and grieving Thorn, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.24, 26.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102523:104"/>
                  <p>The Vine is fruitful, which is that which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt mentions, <hi>She ſhall be as a fruitful Vine;</hi> and further he adds, <hi>By the ſides of thine Houſe;</hi> To ſhew that ſhe ſhall reſemble the nobleſt and choiceſt Vine.

                  <p>The Lord hath promiſed alſo to bleſs our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with his Grace and good Spirit. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be a God to our Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, in their Generations, for an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee:</hi> And to give them his holy Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Off-ſpring.</hi> He hath promiſed to circumciſe their hearts to love him in ſincerity and truth: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and all thy Soul, that thou mayeſt live.</hi> He hath promiſed that our Children ſhall be like Olive plants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.3, <hi>Thy Children like Olive Plants round about thy Table:</hi> By which we may underſtand (as <hi>Mollerus</hi> obſerves upon this Text) that Children ſhall be Comforts and Ornaments to their Parents; (for Oil is uſed to ſignifie joy and gladneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. and was uſed by the Jews by way of Ornament and Beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.46.) And alſo that they ſhall be furniſhed with the Gifts and Graces of Gods Spirit, (which are compared to Ovl, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.3, 4, 8.)

And that they ſhall be of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſpoſition, reſembling the holy Cherubims. (When <hi>Solomon</hi> made Cherubims within the Oracle, he made them of the Olive-Tree, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.23.) Laſtly, By this Metaphor may be ſignified their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant progreſs and perſeverance in Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all their days; (the Olive continuing full of green Leaves all the year long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.8.) The Lord hath promiſed alſo to give his Grace and good Spirit unto our Servants, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh,— and alſo upon the Servants, and upon the Handmaids in thoſe days will I pour out my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath promiſed to bleſs his Peoples Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with peace, and to prevent Jars and Diſcords, which are a great hindrance to the good of a Family, and that he will help them to govern their Families in a holy manner, <hi>Job</hi> 5.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace, and thou ſhalt viſit thy Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation and ſhalt not ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. God hath promiſed to give his People flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Families, by which we are not only or chiefly to underſtand their flouriſhing in reſpect of outward proſperity, but rather their flouriſhing in reſpect of the abundance of heavenly and ſpiritual Bleſſings, wherewith the Lord will bleſs them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.11. <hi>The Houſe of the Wicked ſhall be overthrown, but the Tabernacle of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall flouriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord hath promiſed to bleſs his People in every work of their hands, and to proſper them therein, and ſo conſequently in this work of Family-Inſtruction: <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.20. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in all thy works, and in all that thou putteſt thine
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102523:105"/>hand unto.</hi> Iſa. 65.22, 23. <hi>Mine Elect ſhall long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the work of their hands: They ſhall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the Seed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their Off-ſpring with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee there are variety of Promiſes for us to act our faith upon, in reference to our Families.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſome will be ready to ſay, <hi>I ſee all things in my Family running croſs to theſe Promiſes; My Children are not Olive-Plants, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Bryars and Thorns: I can ſee no fruit of my Labours either upon my Children or Servants: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of knowing that my Tabernacle ſhall be in peace, I find Jars and Diſcords ariſing daily; Inſtead of flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, I find withering and decaying; I find luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deadneſs growing upon my Family, and therefore I finding all things running contrary to theſe Promiſes, I know not how to reſt upon God for bleſſing, converting, ſanctifying, and ſaving of the Members of my Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you find God with-holding Family bleſſings, and that he doth not accompliſh Family-promiſes, enquire into the cauſe why God deals thus with you; and to that end let me put to you theſe following Queries:
<list>
                        <item>1. Do you not harbour ſome unmortified ſins in your hearts? Is there not ſome evil in the managing of your Callings, or in your Converſations, which cauſeth God to with-hold theſe good things from you? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Your iniquities have turned away theſe things, &amp; your ſins have with-holden good things from you.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Are you careful and diligent to obey the Voice of the Lord? If not, that may be the reaſon why you do not enjoy theſe promiſed mercies, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.15. <hi>And this ſhall come to paſs, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102523:105"/>
                        <item>3. Do you get up betimes that you may have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to pray with and pray for your Family, do you pray hard, and cry mightily to God for them? Do you labour to purifie your ſelves as God is pure? Do you walk uprightly? If you would do thus, God would ſoon make your Families flouriſh, <hi>Job</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>If thou wouldeſt ſeek unto God betimes, and make thy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications unto the Almighty, if thou wert pure and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſurely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy Righteouſneſs proſperous.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Are you diligent in teaching your Families? Do you ſet your hearts, your whole hearts to this work? You ought to do it if you would proſper in it; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.21. <hi>In every work that he began in the ſervice of the Houſe of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandment, to ſeek his God, he did it with all his heart, and proſpered.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. Are you not deficient in the duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If ſo, poſſibly that may be the reaſon why God blaſts your Labours, for the promiſe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is made to ſuch as meditate on Gods word, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>This Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therein, for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. Do you apply theſe promiſes to your ſelves, and believe in God, that he will give you the good things that are wrapped up in theſe promiſes? If not it is your unbelief that hinders your reaping the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of theſe Promiſes: For if you did believe them, they ſhould be performed in <hi>due ſeaſon:</hi> Luk. 1.45. <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that believeth, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:102523:106"/>
                        <item>7. Are you not in a backſlidden condition? And is not your forſaking of God, the cauſe why God forſakes you, and gives no bleſſing to your Labours? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Why tranſgreſs ye the Commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot proſper? Becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, he hath alſo forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though you do not ſee the promiſes which relate to your Families accompliſhed, but all things ſeem rather to run contrary to them, yet you muſt not give over hoping in them, and waiting for them. After God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seed, it was twenty five years before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born; for he was but ſeventy five years old when he departed out of <hi>Charan,</hi> which was the time God promiſed to make of him a great Nation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. <hi>And Abraham was an hundred years old when his Son Iſaac was born unto him,</hi> Gen. 21.5. It was ſo long before this promiſe began to have any accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that if he had conſidered the deadneſs of his own Body, or the deadneſs of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. natural Reaſon would have told him it was a vain thing for him to hope for Children: But <hi>Abraham</hi> having a promiſe of God to ground his faith upon, <hi>believed in hope againſt hope, and did not ſtagger at the Promiſe through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> verſe 18, 20. Suppoſe you have waited for the Promiſes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to your Families twenty years, and ſee nothing of them made good, ſuppoſe you ſee nothing in your Children or Servants to encourage you to hope, but rather many diſcouragements; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſes to ground your Faith and Hope upon, you muſt imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> who againſt hope belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in hope that it ſhould be according to what was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102523:106"/>ſpoken and promiſed by God; you muſt not ſtagger at the Promiſes through unbelief, but continue ſtrong in faith, and thereby you ſhall give glory to God: We are oft-times admoniſhed that we have need of Patience as well as Faith, to wait for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Promiſes; as we may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35, 36. <hi>Caſt not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of Reward: for ye have need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that after ye have done the will of God ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe:</hi> Heb. 6.12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Promiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Promiſe in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.7. <hi>They that dwell under his ſhadow ſhall return, they ſhall revive as the Corn, they ſhall grow as the Vine, the ſcent thereof ſhall be as the Wine of Lebanon,</hi> may be of great uſe to ſuch godly perſons as find their Families to be in a languiſhing condition, ſome unconverted, others that gave hope of a work of grace wrought in them, declined and gone backward, deadneſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs upon moſt of the Members of the Family. And therefore I ſhall open the promiſe, and ſhew how we ſhould come to enjoy the bleſſings that are contained in it.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having promiſed ſeveral bleſſings to his people, verſe 4, 5, 6. doth promiſe verſe 7. to make them bleſſings to others; <hi>They that dwell under his ſhadow</hi>— hat is, under <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſhadow, mentioned verſ. 5. By <hi>Iſrael,</hi> underſtand all the ſervants of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.21. To dwell under ones ſhadow, may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to be in the ſame Houſe or Family, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Only unto theſe men do nothing, for therefore came they under the ſhadow of my Roof;</hi> that is, into my Family, or my Houſe. So that this Promiſe, though it be of a larger extent than particular Families, may be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102523:107"/>ſafely and warrantably applied by every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who hath a Family, in reference to all that dwell under his Roof.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee what is promiſed concerning thoſe that dwell under a godly mans ſhadow:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>They ſhall return</hi>—Returning is ſometimes applied to the Repentance and Converſion of ſuch as are in a ſtate of ſin; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. Sometimes to the returning of ſuch as have backſlidden from God after Converſion, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. Both may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood here; the impenitent and unconverted ſhall be converted to God, and ſuch as are backſlidden ſince their Converſion, ſhall be brought back again to the Lord.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>They ſhall revive as the Corn:</hi> They, that is, they that dwell under <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſhadow <hi>ſhall revive</hi>—God will take off their deadneſs, and give them living and lively ſpirits in his ſervice: <hi>They ſhall revive as the Corn:</hi> How is that? The Corn lies dead under the ground for a time, before it comes up; and after it is ſprung up, winter-froſts and cold winds make it hang the head, as if it would dye again; yet by the warm beams of the Sun, and the bleſſing of Heaven, it revives again. Are there any in your Families where the Seed of the word ſeemeth to lie dead, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſprings forth as yet, that ſpeaketh life? Are there others where there did once appear ſome fruit, but it ſeems to be withered? Here is ground for faith to act upon for both ſorts in theſe words, <hi>They ſhall revive as the Corn.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>They ſhall grow as the Vine:</hi> Here is promiſed to the Members of our Families, 1. Growth in Grace: 2. Growth reſembling the growing of the Vine: How is that? The cutting and pruning of the Vine makes it thrive, and grow more fruitful,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102523:107"/>and ſo it ſignifieth a growing under afflictions and temptations; loſſes and croſſes ſhall not hinder but further their growth: Again, they ſhall grow as the Vine; not as Briars and Thorns; they ſhall not grow worſe and worſe, but grow in grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We may know what we muſt do to obtain theſe bleſſings for our Families mentioned in this promiſe, if we conſider what God required of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and what he promiſed to do for <hi>Iſrael</hi> before he gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> this promiſe, <hi>They that dwell under his ſhadow,</hi> &amp;c. As,

They that teach others ſhould labour to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exemplarily in all things towards thoſe whom they inſtruct: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Be thou an example of the Believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity:</hi> Tit. 2.7. <hi>In all things ſhewing thy ſelf a Pattern of good works.</hi>— Inſtruction from a good man is embraced more readily, and worketh more powerfully than that which comes from one that walketh contrary to what he teacheth. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> being a good man was inſtrumental by his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to convert many to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23, 24. <hi>He exhorted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord; for he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and of Faith, and much People was added to the Lord.</hi> When <hi>Levi,</hi> who taught the people, walked with God, he turned many from iniquity, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of Truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: He walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity:</hi> A good converſation is ſuch a powerful means to convert Souls, that ſome who are not

That it is our duty when we return to God, to endeavour to reform our Families. 2. That when we do return to God, and endeavour to reform our Families, God will ſo bleſs our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that iniquity ſhall be put far from our Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. And accordingly we find that when the Maſter of the Family feareth God, and doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his duty labour to bring his Family to fear and ſerve the Lord, the Lord hath bleſſed the whole Family with the fear of his Name; as we may ſee in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who fearing God, and being a devout man, all his houſe feared God alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1, 2.

<list>
                        <item>1. It is a work that God calleth you to do, as you may ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. And the plea of inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not a ſufficient excuſe for neglecting the work to which you are called of God. When God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to be a Prophet, he would have excuſed himſelf by pleading his inability, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ah Lord! behold I cannot ſpeak, for I am a Child.</hi> Did God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this excuſe? No, but reproves him, and tells him he ſhould go where-ever he ſent him, and ſpeak whatever he commanded him, although he looked upon himſelf as unable as a Child for the work he was called to, Verſ. 7. <hi>But the Lord ſaid unto me, Say not that I am a Child, for thou ſhalt go unto all that I ſhall ſend thee, and whatſoever I command thee thouſhalt ſpeak.</hi> When God called <hi>Moſes</hi> to go and ſpeak to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would have refuſed, and pleads his unfitneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not eloquent, but of a ſlow ſpeech, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4 10. <hi>Moſes ſaid unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor ſince thou haſt ſpoken unto thy Servant, but I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue.</hi> But what did God ſay? He refuſed this plea, and commandeth him to go about his work, verſ. 11, 12. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Who hath made mans mouth? Or who maketh the Dumb or Deaf, or the Seeing, or the Blind? Have not I the Lord? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:102523:111"/>
                        <item>2. God can do great things by weak means, and and therefore your weakneſs ſhould not deter you from this work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine Enemies, that thou mighteſt ſtill the Enemy and the Avenger:</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and God hath choſen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. God will be with you in this work, and that may ſtrengthen you to ſet upon it, though the work be great, and your ſtrength be ſmall: <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Be ſtrong all ye people of the Land, ſaith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> The Jews complained they were not able to build, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.10. but to take off this plea, God promiſeth them his preſence and aſſiſtance, as that which was ſufficient to ſtrengthen them for that difficult work which they complained they were not able to go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; <hi>Be ſtrong and work, for I am with you.</hi> What <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he had a great work to do, and might be diſcouraged becauſe he was young, and unable for ſuch great ſervice, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.5, 16. <hi>Ariſe and be doing, and the Lord be with thee,</hi> (or as <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> render the words) <hi>the Lord will be with thee.</hi> So may I ſay unto you, Let not your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs for this work keep you from it, but ariſe and be doing, and the Lord will be with you. You may be ſure the Lord will be with you in teaching and inſtructing your Families, for he commandeth you to do this work, as I have already ſhewn you out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.7. and ſeveral other Scriptures: And you need not doubt of having Gods preſence in every
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102523:111"/>work and ſervice which he commands you to do, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Have not I commanded thee? Be ſtrong, and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whitherſoever thou goeſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Although your abilities be but ſmall, yet if you teach and inſtruct your Families according to the ability which God hath given you, you ſhall by ſo doing glorifie God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another — If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. By improving thoſe mean abilities which God hath given you in teaching your Families, you ſhall have them increaſed, <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright, Prov.</hi> 10.29. The man that had but two Talents, trading with them gained other two, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.17.</item>
                        <item>6. He that hath but very little and mean abilities, if he improve thoſe ſmall abilities faithfully, in the place and ſphear that God hath ſet him in, ſhall have a great Reward from God, as well as they that have had greater abilities; <hi>Luke</hi> 19.17. <hi>Well, thou good ſervant, becauſe thou haſt been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten Cities.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Difficult works will be carried on ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully by weak means, where there is a willing mind. The building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after it had lain waſte ſeventy years, was a hard work; the ſtrength and eſtates of the Jews were much impaired by their long captivity. Their Adverſaries ſcoffed at them, thinking they went about an impoſſible thing, when they endeavoured to build up the wall of the City, and ſaid, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>What do theſe feeble Jews? Will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102523:112"/>they fortifie themſelves? Will they revive the ſtones out of the heaps of Rubbiſh which are burnt? Even that which they build, if a Fox go up, he ſhall even break down their ſtone Wall.</hi> And not only their Adverſaries, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jews themſelves thought they were unable to carry on this work, verſ. 10. <hi>And Judah ſaid, The ſtrength of the Bearers of Burdens is decayed, and there is much Rubbiſh, ſo that we are not able to build the wall.</hi> Yet when they went to it with a willing mind, the work went on proſperouſly, verſ. 6. <hi>So built we the wall, and all the wall was joyned together unto the half thereof; for the People had a mind to work.</hi> It argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſlothful ſpirit to deſiſt from our duty, becauſe there are ſome difficulties attend it: <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.13. <hi>The ſlothful man ſaith, There is a Lion in the way, a Lion in the ſtreets.</hi> Get but a willing mind, and then this work will not be difficult, but eaſie and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle acknowledgeth that the Hebrews had but little knowledge, he ſaith of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Oracles of God, and are become ſuch as have need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat:</hi> Yet he calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe perſons whom he confeſſeth had need of teaching themſelves, to exhort one another daily, Chap. 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Though ſome have more Talents than others, yet there is no man without a Talent to trade withal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.15. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.7. Now ſuppoſe your gifts are of the meaneſt ſort, you muſt improve
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102523:112"/>them for the good of your Families. That man who had but one Talent, becauſe he hid it in a Napkin, was caſt into outer darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24, 25, 28, 30.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If your want of abilities diſcourage you from this work, ſeek to have your abilities increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; it is lawful to covet gifts for the edification of others, as well as grace for the good of your own ſoul: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Deſire ſpiritual gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, How you ſhould get your Gifts and Abilities increaſed?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer:
<list>
                        <item>1. Pray to God to endue you with ſuch gifts as may fit you for the work and ſervice of the place and ſtation that he hath ſet you in; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights</hi>—And he which is the Author of every good gift, will deny no good thing to them that ſeek him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. Though you have little or no abilities, yet God can put power into thoſe that have no might, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he encreaſeth ſtrength.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Study the Scriptures, and other good Books, but the Scriptures above all other Books; read them diligently, and meditate upon them: Hereby you ſhall be enabled to inſtruct your Families, and be furniſhed with abilities for every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17.</item>
                        <item>3. Imploy thoſe abilities which God hath given you in teaching your Families, thereby you ſhall have them increaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102523:113"/>that hath</hi> (that is, who improveth what he hath, as appeareth from the context) <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Walk in the fear of God; by ſo doing the Lord will increaſe both the gifts and graces of his Spirit in you: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.13, 14. <hi>He will bleſs them that fear the Lord both ſmall and great. The Lord ſhall encreaſe you more and more, you and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. Look unto Chriſt who hath received Gifts to beſtow upon the ſons of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were endued with excellent Gifts, they were inriched with all utterance and all knowledge, ſo that they came behind other Churches in no gift. And how came they to be thus inriched in gifts? They had all their gifts from Jeſus Chriſt, as you may ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5, 7.</item>
                     </list>

                  <p>Sixthly, Though your gifts be ſmall, yet if you be diligent, and do the beſt you can, God will accept your work. They that offered for the Tabernacle Goats Hair and Rams Skins, were accepted, as well as they that offered Gold, and Silver, and precious Stones, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.5, 6, 7, 8. Such as could not bring a Lamb for a Treſpaſs-offering, were permitted to bring two Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons, and ſuch as could not do this, were allowed to bring the tenth part of an Ephah of fine flower, and he that brought the ſmalleſt offering was accepted, as well as he that brought the greateſt, if he could bring no better; <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.6, 7, 11, 13. God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhewed himſelf ready to accept of weak ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where a man hath a willing mind to do better, but wants ability, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind it is accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly, If you ſay you know not how, or in what way to teach your Children and Servants the holy Scriptures; you may, if you are not provided of a better help, make uſe of the Scriptural Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm which I have publiſhed with this Treatiſe; wherein I have ſelected ſuch Texts of Scripture as are uſeful for the grounding of younger perſons in the knowledge and belief of the Articles of our Faith, and to bring them acquainted with their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſerable condition by nature, the neceſſity of Regeneration, the Covenant of Grace, the way to obtain peace with God, and remiſſion of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and direct and perſwade them to embrace a godly life, and draw them on to the practiſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the love of God and our Neighbour, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, contentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to reſtrain them from lying, ſwearing, the love of pleaſure, idleneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and ſuch other ſins as young perſons are apt to be led into; and alſo to prepare them for, and comfort them under ſuch afflictions as they are liable unto: Which I have endeavoured to digeſt in ſuch a method, and with that ſubſerviency each unto other, as may be helpful both to their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Memories, and alſo work upon their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, If you cannot read, be ſwift to hear Gods word, and get your Neighbours to read to you, and labour to retain in your memories what you have heard others read, and teach that to your Families which God helps you to carry away in your memories.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Dulneſs of Underſtanding and weakneſs of Memory oft-times proceed from the neglect and diſuſe of thoſe Faculties; good Tools will grow ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and unfit for ſervice, if they be not uſed. It was the field of the ſlothful which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw all grown over with Thorns, and covered with Nettles, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30, 31. Though a perſon may have good parts, yet if from his youth he neglect to bend his mind to underſtand the things of God, and to get the word of God into his memory, he will find his underſtanding dull, in apprehending, and his memo-weak in retaining Divine Objects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though your Children and Servants ſeem to be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102523:115"/>very dull and ſimple, yet by inſtructing them out of the word of God, they may become very wiſe and prudent perſons: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple:</hi> Pſal. 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy word giveth light, it giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the ſimple. Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the word of God, ſaith, <hi>It will give ſubtilty to the ſimple, to the young man knowledge and diſcretion, Prov.</hi> 1.4. Though your children be ſo raw, dull, and ignorant, that they know nothing at all of the things of God, yet by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them out of the word of God, you may bring them to know and fear the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael in their hearing, that their Children which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If your Children and Servants be dull of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and have weak memories, this ſhould not cauſe you to deſiſt from inſtructing them, but you ſhould rather take the more pains with them; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. <hi>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then muſt he put to the more ſtrength; but wiſdom is profitable to direct.</hi> The duller any perſons are, the more need they have of being taught. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Ye are dull of hearing,—ye have need that one teach you.</hi>—Though we are guilty of much folly, and ignorance, and dulneſs, the Lord our God doth not ceaſe from teaching and inſtructing us, but guides and directs us continually, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22, 23, 24. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee; nevertheleſs I am continually with thee—thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel.</hi> If God who is our Maſter, doth not leave off inſtructing us, becauſe of our ſimplicity and dulneſs, ſhall we think much to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102523:116"/>teach our Servants, becauſe of their ignorance and dulneſs?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If your Children and Servants be dull, and have weak memories, you muſt ſuit your inſtructions to their capacities; and ſeeing, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth, that when a man hath to do with blunt tools, <hi>Wiſdom is profitable to direct,</hi> wiſely conſider by what ways and means you may ſo carry on this work of Inſtruction, as may make moſt for their edification, in regard of the dulneſs of their underſtandings, and weakneſs of their memories: And to this purpoſe I ſhall ſuggeſt to you theſe following directions.</p>
                  <p>1. Let the Scriptures which you teach them be plain and eaſie: There are ſome things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hard to be underſtood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. And there be other things that are plain and eaſie. Now they that are to deal with dull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, muſt wave thoſe things that are hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11. and muſt teach them ſuch things as are plain and eaſie, otherwiſe they will profit little or nothing by the inſtructions which you give them: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Except ye utter by the tongue words eaſie to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall ſpeak into the air.</hi> And therefore if there be any obſcurity either in the matter, or in the words and phraſes of thoſe Scriptures which you teach them, explain the ſenſe and meaning thereof, as the Levites did, when they read the Law to the people, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Let the Scriptures which you teach them be ſhort, and ſuch as may be eaſily remembred, as well as eaſily underſtood. Let them alſo be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſuch as comprehend much matter in few words. As for inſtance: <hi>Solomon</hi> comprehends the whole duty of man in few words, when he ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102523:116"/>
                     <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſums up all that is delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, and by the Prophets, in reference to our Duty to our Neighbour in a ſhort ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> comprehends all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are ſcattered up and down the word of God concerning our duty towards our Neighbour, in one ſhort ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. <hi>If there be any other Commandment it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reſolved that grand queſtion, what a man ſhould do to be ſaved, in few words, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved? And they ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy Houſe.</hi> Perſons of the weakeſt memories may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch ſhort Scriptures as theſe are, and by retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch comprehenſive Scriptures, they may know and remember much of their duty, although they remember but few words.</p>
                  <p>3. If your Children and Servants be dull, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame things over and over to them, that they may be the more imprinted in their minds, and be more deeply rooted in their memories. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of ſuch as were dull, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11. ſaith verſ. 12. <hi>Ye have need one teach you again which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> Teaching of Truths once or twice, is not enough for ſuch as are dull; they muſt be taught the ſame things again and again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.10. <hi>Precept muſt be upon Precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, and there a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Direct them to, and put them upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102523:117"/>of thoſe things that will help the infirmities of their Underſtandings and Memories: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, Stir them up to pray to God to give them his holy Spirit: The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and will make a man of a quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, 3. It is his work to lead us into all truth, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. And to help the infirmities of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, by bringing Gods Word to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>John</hi> 14.26.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, Stir them up to repent of their ſins: It is ſin which darkens our minds, and keeps us from the knowledge of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Silly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Such perſons as do not leave their ſins, will abide in ignorance, although they be Hearers and Learners of Gods word as long as they live. But as for ſuch as repent of their ſins, and turn to God, though they be ſimple perſons, yea ſuch as have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſimplicity and hated knowledge, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to make known his word to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Turn you at my reproof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Thirdly, Adviſe them to exerciſe their minds in ſtudying and ſearching into the Scriptures, and to exerciſe their memories by committing ſome porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods word to their memories every day. Hereby ſuch as have weak memories, and could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member little or nothing at the firſt, will find their Memories improved wonderfully, and not only their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102523:117"/>Memories, but their Underſtandings alſo. Uſe and Exerciſe of the Faculties of the Soul, tend much to their improvement, which the Scripture as well as daily Experience doth teſtifie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Even thoſe who by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</hi>

Or have you not been ſtubborn and diſobedient in your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards God your heavenly Father? Or did you not neglect inſtructing your Children, and too much indulge them in their own wills and ways whilſt they were young? Or have you not ſome other way provoked God by your ſins, to afflict you with ſtubborn and diſobedient Children? If ſo, then humble your Souls before God for your ſins, and thereby you may prevail with God to remove this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102523:118"/>puniſhment from you, and to bow and bend your Childrens hearts ſo, as they ſhall come and humble themſelves before you, and ſubmit to thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which you ſhall give them out of the word of God. We know God can work wonderful changes in the hearts of men; he can make thoſe that have been an affliction to us, to come and humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.14. <hi>The ſons of them that afflicted thee ſhall come bending unto thee, and all they that deſpiſed thee ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoles of thy feet.</hi> And what more likely way is there to bring this about, then for us to bow down, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord vouchſafes to teach hard-hearted rebellious gainſaying perſons, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.16, 17.20. <hi>They and our Fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandments, and refuſed to obey, neither were mindful of the Wonders thou didſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a Captain to return to their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> We ſee here what a rebellious people the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, but did this cauſe God to give over inſtructing them? No, for it is ſaid verſ. 20. <hi>Thou gaveſt thy good ſpirit to inſtruct them.</hi> And the like we may ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2, 3. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts, a people that provoketh me to anger centinually to my face.</hi>— So alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>To Iſrael he ſaith, All day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gainſaying people.</hi> Stretching out of the hands was uſed by thoſe that taught and inſtructed the people, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.1. So that where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have ſtretched forth my hands to a gainſaying and rebellious people;</hi> the meaning is, that he inſtructed them, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102523:118"/>invited them to repentance.

This will be a means to break their hard hearts, and lead them to Repentance, and keep them from being rebellious for time to come: It will break their hearts, though they be as hard as the Rock, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Is not my word lik as a fire, ſaith the Lord, and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in pieces?</hi> It will be a means to lead them to repentance, though they be of ſuch a refractory ſpirit as to oppoſe the the Truth, and ſhould be ſuch ſlaves to Satan, as to be led captive by him when and to what he pleaſeth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, &amp;c. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken captive at his will.</hi>—It may keep them from being rebellious for time to come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 7, 8. <hi>He eſtabliſhed a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and might not be as their Fathers a ſtubborn and rebellious Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We ſhould ſin againſt God if we ſhould leave off teaching our Children or Servants becauſe they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102523:119"/>carry themſelves unkindly and diſobediently towards us. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> carried themſelves ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly and rebelliouſly both againſt God and againſt <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7, 19. yet <hi>Samuel</hi> tells them he would not ceaſe to pray for them and to teach them, leſt he ſhould ſin againſt God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi> It is the Will and Command of God that rebellious and hard-hearted perſons ſhould be taught his Word, as we may ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.3, 4, 7. where the Lord acknowledgeth the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be rebellious, impudent, and ſtiff-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet he ſaith to the Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are moſt rebellious.</hi> And if it be Gods Command that the Rebellious ſhould be taught his Word, it muſt needs be a ſin to forbear teaching our Families, though ſome or all of them are rebellious perſons; for then we ſin, when we tranſgreſs any of the Commandments of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Though our Children ſhould for the preſent rebel againſt thoſe Inſtructions and Commands which they receive from us, yet afterward they may conſider their ways, and repent, and follow thoſe Counſels and Inſtructions which we have given them. The elder Son ſpoken of in the Parable at firſt refuſed to obey his Father, but afterwards he repented and did what his Father commanded him: <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.28, 29. <hi>A certain man had two Sons, and he came to the firſt, and ſaid, Son go work to day in my Vinyard; he anſwered and ſaid, I will not; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he repented and went.</hi>

                  <p>4. If your Children be hard-hearted, weep over them when you inſtruct them, that may be a means to break their hearts; <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. <hi>What mean you to weep, and to break my heart?</hi> It is ſaid <hi>Job</hi> 14.13. <hi>The Water wear the Stones:</hi> Seeing waters will wear the ſtones, why may not you hope by your tears to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and break the ſtony hearts of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>

                     <hi>Mr Children are young, and it is too ſoon to begin to teach them the Scriptures; they can't underſtand any thing as yet, if I ſhould go about to teach them; and beſides, I am afraid I ſhould prophane the word of God, and take the Name of God in vain, if I ſhould teach them whilſt they are young; and therefore I will let this work alone until they are grown up unto years of diſcretion, then I will do it.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We can't begin too ſoon to teach our Children the word of God. As ſoon as they have learned to ſpeak, we ſhould endeavour to learn them the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Whom ſhall he teach know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine? Them that are weaned from the Milk, and drawn from the Breſts.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is rendred by the Vulgar Latin, <hi>Ab infantia, From thy Infancy,</hi> and by <hi>Schmidius, A primâ infantia, From thy firſt Infancy,</hi> the ſame greek word is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15. <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 7.19. <hi>Young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Luke</hi> 2.12. <hi>A Babe.</hi> The word imports, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was taught the Scriptures very early, as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102523:120"/>ſoon as ever he was capable of learning them. That Precept which is given <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the Way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it;</hi> implies that we ſhould begin betimes to teach our Children the ways of the Lord. The Hebrew word uſed there for a Child, as <hi>Schindler</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>totam aetatem teneram complectitur,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all a mans tender years, as, Infancy, Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Youth. It is rendred a Babe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Babe wept;</hi> and it is applied to one that hath not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to diſcern between good and evil, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Before the Child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good.</hi>—So that when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Train up a Child in the way that he ſhould go,</hi> this Precept reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our youngeſt Children, and intimates we ſhould begin very early with them, to teach and inſtruct them as ſoon as there is any capacity in them to learn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Satan begins betimes to corrupt our Children, and to teach them that which is evil: We ſee many Children learn to lie as ſoon as they can ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>They go aſtray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies:</hi> Others learn to mock the people of God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.23. <hi>There came forth little Children out of the City and mocked him;</hi> Others learn other vices. And ſhall not we begin as early to teach them good things, as Satan begins to teach them wicked and evil things?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a greater capacity in Children to learn and underſtand, than many are aware of; They are capable of receiving the holy Ghoſt whilſt they are in their Mothers womb, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15, 41. And ſuch on whom God pours out his Spirit whilſt they are Infants, are capable betimes of knowing the things of God. We read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Out of the mouths of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102523:120"/>Babes and Sucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine Enemies, that thou mighteſt ſtill the Enemy and the Avenger.</hi> And we find this Scripture applied by Chriſt to the little Children, who cried in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, Matth.</hi> 21.15, 16. Theſe little Children by the Revelation of Gods Spirit knew and underſtood that Jeſus Chriſt was the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which thing was hid from many of the Phariſees, who were wiſe and prudent men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Suppoſe our Children ſhould not underſtand for the preſent ſome of thoſe Scriptures which we teach them, yet they may underſtand them, and reap great benefit from them hereafter, it may be after we are laid in our Graves, <hi>John</hi> 12.16. <hi>Theſe things underſtood not his Diſciples at the firſt, but when Jeſus was glorified, then remembred they that thoſe things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him, and that they had done theſe things unto him.</hi> And in another place we find that the Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts death were much helped in their Faith, by remembring a word that Chriſt had ſaid to them in his Life time, about his building of the Temple in three days after it ſhould be deſtroyed, <hi>John</hi> 2.22. <hi>When he was riſen from the dead, his Diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not a profaning of Gods Name, or of his holy Word to teach our Children the Scriptures whilſt they are young, but it makes much for the glorifying of God. When little Children cried in the Temple, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David,</hi> the chief Prieſts and Scribes were ſore diſpleaſed; but what ſaid Chriſt to this? He juſtifies them, he ſaith it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to Gods praiſe: yea, ſo far was he from counting it a profaning of Gods Name, that he calls
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102523:121"/>it a perfection of praiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe.</hi> And therefore we ſhould look upon this as a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Satan, when we are perſwaded to neglect inſtructing our Children while they are young, leſt we ſhould thereby profane the Name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Jeſus Chriſt hath given a Charge for the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Lambs as well as his Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 21.15. <hi>Loveſt thou me? Feed my Lambs.</hi> He was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with thoſe that would have hinder'd little Children from being brought unto him, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>They brought young Children to him, that he ſhould touch them, and his Diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them; but when Jeſus ſaw it, he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> It is the duty of little Children to praiſe the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.12, 13. <hi>Both young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praiſe the Name of the Lord.</hi>—And how can they do this, except we teach them to praiſe the Lord? Amongſt the Offerings under the Law, we find ſeveral Creatures offered to God very young; <hi>Samuel</hi> offered a ſucking Lamb, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.9. And <hi>Aaron</hi> is required to offer a young Calf, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.2. And they that were poor, and could not go to the price of a Lamb, were to offer two young Pigeons, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.7. This may teach us, that we cannot dedicate our ſelves or our Children too ſoon to the Lord; but the younger our Children are, when we begin to train them up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of God, the more acceptable it will be to the Lord, who deſireth the knowledge of God more than Burnt-Offerings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:102523:121"/>
                  <p n="7">7. We know not how little a time we may live with our Children, or our Children may live with us, and therefore 'tis not ſafe deferring this work; for, <hi>All fleſh is graſs,</hi> Iſa. 40.6. and graſs is of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nature, <hi>In the morning it flouriſheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut down and withereth,</hi> Pſal. 90.6.

It may be if you examine the ſeveral members of your Family, you ſhall not find all of them ſo eminent and abounding in knowledge as you think them to be, before you have made trial. Who would have thought that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> who was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould have been ſo ignorant in the Myſtery of Regeneration, that when Chriſt ſpake of a mans being born again, or elſe he could not ſee the Kingdom of God, he ſhould reply, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?

Faithfulneſs to God, and ſuch as are under our charge, is ſhown in diſcharging our duty to a few, as well as to many; and he that is not faithful to a few, would not be faithful if he had many commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.10. <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful alſo in much, and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much.</hi> They that have but a few things committed to their truſt, if they are faithful in them, ſhall have a great and glorious Reward, as well as they that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with much, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.23. <hi>His Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>

That the plea of other buſineſs may not take you off from teaching your Families the word of God; conſider how acceptable this work is to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. No work or buſineſs doth more pleaſe him, than to ſee us learning his word our ſelves, and teaching our Families what we have learnt. When Chriſt came to <hi>Martha</hi>'s Houſe, ſhe received him, and took great care and pains to entertain Chriſt, and thoſe that came with him, and this was a very good and pious work; but <hi>Mary ſat at Jeſus feet,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102523:129"/>and heard his word.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Martha</hi> goes to Chriſt, and complains that <hi>Mary</hi> had left her to ſerve alone: But what anſwer did Chriſt give her? It was this, <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things; but one thing is needful, and Mary hath choſen that good part which ſhall not be taken away from her,</hi> Luke 10.38, 39, 40, 41, 42. Where we ſee Chriſt commended <hi>Mary</hi>'s choice, who ſat at his feet, and heard his word, above <hi>Martha</hi>'s, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into her houſe, and provided for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and his followers. And yet how good a work was it to receive and entertain Chriſt! There was coſt, and care, and pains attending this work. And as Chriſt is highly pleaſed with ſuch as give their minds to hear and learn his word, more than with thoſe that were able and willing to feaſt him and his Apoſtles; So alſo it is a very acceptable work unto Chriſt, to ſee us inſtructing and teaching our Families; which doth plainly appear from his anſwer to the man out of whom the Devils depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he deſired to be with him, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>Now the man out of whom the Devils were departed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him that he might be with him; but Jeſus ſent him away ſaying, Return to thine own Houſe, and ſhew how great things God hath done unto thee:</hi> The man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he might be with Chriſt. Now to follow Chriſt, this was a good work, it might have condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced very much to the good of his Soul, for to have ſat under Chriſts Miniſtry, and to have heard his Doctrine; poſſibly the man deſired this to expreſs his gratitude, by miniſtring to Chriſt, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perſon, to do ſuch ſervice on all occaſions as he ſhould command him; yet the Lord Jeſus chuſeth rather to ſend him home to his own houſe to inſtruct his Family, than to anſwer his deſire in ſuffering the

                        <item>2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer:</hi> 1.

As, That God made man upright, and created him after his own Image, in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; That <hi>Adam</hi> did not continue in this eſtate, but ſinned againſt God by eating the forbidden fruit; That all men have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God; That the wages of ſin is death; That Jeſus Chriſt died for our ſins; That he roſe again from the dead the third day; That he aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth there at Gods right hand to make Interceſſion for us; That whoſoever believeth in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion of ſins, and have eternal life; That the dead ſhall be raiſed, and be all judged at the laſt day; That at the day of Judgment they that have done evil ſhall be caſt into Hell Fire, where they ſhall remain for ever; and they that have lived god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall be taken into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if you have not ability to teach them the more abſtruſe and myſterious points of the Chriſtian Religion, teach them thoſe things which are plain and eaſie; and whilſt you do ſo, God will open your Underſtandings, and give you farther inſight into the Myſteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102523:131"/>That man who had but one Talent, and out of fear did not improve his Talent, but went and hid it in the Earth, was not excuſed by his having but a mean Talent, or by his pleading his fearfulneſs; but is called by his Lord a wicked &amp; a ſlothful ſervant, and was caſt into outer darkneſs, where there was weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24, 25, 26, 30. <hi>He which had received the one Talent, came and ſaid, Lord, I knew thee, that thou art a hard man,—And I was afraid, and went and hid thy Talent in the Earth; lo there thou haſt that is thine: His Lord anſwered and ſaid unto him, Thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not ſtrawed; thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the Exchangers, that I might have received mine own with uſury.

Be ſenſible of your own inability to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures of your ſelves, and pray to God to open your underſtandings, and to guide you into the true and right meaning of his holy word. It is Gods work to open the eyes of our underſtandings, whereby we may underſtand his word, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Then opened he their underſtandings, that they might underſtand the Scriptures:</hi> Prov. 20.12. <hi>The hearing ear, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> And ſeeing it is Gods work to enlighten our

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Read the Scriptures diligently, and mark the coherence of what you read, with that which went before, and that which followeth after; obſerve the ſcope, and conſider well both the words and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe places which have any difficulty in them, this will help you to a right underſtanding of the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Compare one Scripture with another, that which is more obſcure with that which is more clear, that is the way to come to know the mind of Chriſt in the Scriptures: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13, 16. —<hi>Comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual—we have the mind of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Conſider what is the general deſign and ſcope of the whole Scripture; and if you would not wreſt the Scriptures, underſtand and expound particular Texts ſo as they may agree with, and not contradict, the general ſcope and deſign of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                  </p>
                  <p>6. Lean not to your own underſtandings, but truſt in the Lord with all your hearts, rely upon him to keep you from Errour of Judgment, and to lead and guide you into all Truth; you have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promiſes to encourage you to reſt upon God to teach you the truth, and to preſerve you in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of the truth: I will mention ſome of them: <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>When he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth:</hi> John 8.31, 32. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed. And ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> John 6.45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And ye ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>

When we do ſeriouſly ſet our ſelves to reform our hearts and lives, and do refrain our ſelves from every evil way, we ſhall find unexpreſſible
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102523:133"/>ſweetneſs in the word of God, though we found none at all before; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.101, 103. <hi>I have refrained my ſelf from every evil way—How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte?

                     <hi>Anſwer:</hi> Beſides what the Miniſters of Gods word are to do in this kind, it is the duty of Parents and Maſters of Families to teach and inſtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, as hath been proved already by many clear Texts of Scripture; I ſhall re-mind you of ſome of them: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>The Father unto the Children ſhall make known thy truth:</hi> Pſal. 78.5. <hi>He eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children:</hi> Epheſ. 6.4. <hi>And ye Fathers provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently unto thy Children.</hi>— This Precept is not given only to the Prieſts or Levites, but to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 4. So that it is a frivolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for any man to think to put off this work from himſelf, by ſaying, it is the Miniſters work to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe his Children; for God commandeth all Parents to teach his Word to their Children: Yea, it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious falſehood for any man to ſay, This is none of my work to inſtruct my Family, whenas the Lord hath given ſo many and ſuch ſtrict Precepts to every man to inſtruct his Children.</p>

                     <hi>IF every man ſhould take upon him to teach and inſtruct his Family, this would be the way to make every man turn Preacher, and would cauſe the Miniſters of the Word to be ſlighted and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and this makes us not only forbear this work our ſelves, but alſo to diſlike it in others; becauſe we would not have any take upon them the work of the Miniſtry but ſuch as are called to it, and we would not have the publick Miniſtry brought into contempt.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Family-Inſtruction and the work of the Miniſtry, are two diſtinct works; The one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every Maſter of a Family, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to ſuch as are called and ſent forth by God to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> And God hath not called all men to the work of the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers— Are all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers?</hi> We may learn from this Text, 1. That none are to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church, but thoſe whom God ſets there: 2. That God doth ſet ſome, not all, to be Teachers in the Church. Under the Law no man was to take the Office of the Prieſthood without a call from God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that was called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> Yea, God made it death for ſuch as were not called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the Prieſts Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Thou and thy Sons with thee ſhall keep your Prieſts Office, for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102523:136"/>every thing of the Altar, and within the Vail, and ye ſhall ſerve— And the ſtranger that cometh nigh, ſhall be put to death.</hi> What work our Lord Jeſus did in and for the Church of God, he did not do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Call: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And God hath ordained under the Goſpel that every man ſhould improve thoſe gifts which he hath diſtributed to him, within the ſphere and compaſs of his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk, and ſo ordain I in all Churches.</hi> Thoſe works which are in themſelves good works, become ſinful when they are done by thoſe that have no call to do them, and inſtead of being rewarded, they have been puniſhed by the Lord. To burn Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe, was a very good and acceptable work. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> wiſheth that his Prayer might be like Incenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet before thee as incenſe:</hi> Yet when <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> undertook to burn Incenſe, who had no Call to do it, it is called a Tranſgreſſion, and he was puniſhed with Leproſie all his days, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.18, 21. <hi>It appertaineth not unto thee, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, to burn incenſe unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts the Sons of Aaron, that are conſecrated to burn incenſe, go out of the Sanctuary, for thou haſt treſpaſſed; neither ſhall it be for thine honour from the Lord God: And <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah the King was a Leper unto the day of his death.</hi> The more knowledge any man hath of the Scriptures, the leſs fear there is of his taking upon him the work of the Minſtry without a Call from God, (what this Call is, and how a man may diſcern when he hath it, would be too great a digreſſion, if I ſhould here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the explanation thereof) becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102523:136"/>are ſo full, ſo plain, ſo expreſs in this point, That only they that are called of God ſhould take upon them the work and Office of the Miniſtry. So that this Objection, <hi>Every man will turn Preacher if he take upon him to inſtruct his Family in the knowledge of the Scriptures,</hi> is of no force to hinder this work of Family-Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither will the training up our Families in the knowledge of the Scriptures, cauſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry or Miniſters of Gods word to be ſlighted; but on the contrary, the more our Children and Servants are acquainted with the Scriptures, the more they will prize and reverence the Miniſters of Chriſt, for the Scriptures do teach us to eſteem very highly of Chriſts Miniſters, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>We beſeech you, Brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake:</hi> Rom. 10.15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tydings of good things.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> They are ſtiled Chriſts Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt.</hi> And who are more honoured than the Embaſſadours of an Earthly Prince? The Scriptures ſhew what a great ſin it is to deſpiſe the Miniſters of Chriſt; the Lord Jeſus counts himſelf and his Father deſpiſed, when they are deſpiſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me:</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.8. <hi>He that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man but God, who alſo hath given unto us his holy Spirit.</hi> So that the training up of our Families in the fear of God, and knowledge of the Scriptures, will be ſo far from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102523:137"/>cauſing them to ſlight the Miniſters of Chriſt, or the Miniſtry of the Word, that it will cauſe them to reverence and eſteem them.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a great and dangerous miſtake, for a man to neglect reading and ſearching the Scriptures, and inſtructing his Family in the knowledge of the Scriptures, from a perſwaſion that neither he nor his Family need to do any thing more towards the obtaining Salvation, than to follow the Light that is in them.</p>
                  <p>To make this evident, Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no man hath ſo much Light or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but it is neceſſary that he ſhould give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the reading of the Scriptures, thas he may gain more Knowledge. All men may be ranked under theſe two heads, either they are ſuch as abide in their natural unregenerate condition, or they are ſuch as are converted and endued with the grace of God. As for men in their natural condition,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102523:137"/>they are deſtitute of ſaving knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after God:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> Rom. 1.31. <hi>Without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> They are ſaid to be in darkneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.9, 11. <hi>He that ſaith he is in the Light, and hateth his Brother, is in darkneſs even until now—He that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Brother is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe that darkneſs hath blinded his eyes.</hi> They are ſaid not only to be in darkneſs, but to be darkneſs it ſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye Light in the Lord; walk as Children of Light.</hi> And therefore men in their natural condition had need give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to reading of the Scriptures, that they may be inlightned and converted to God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul; the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple;— The Commandment of the Lord is pure, inlightning the eyes:</hi> And that they may be made wiſe to ſalvation; for the knowledge of the Scriptures will make men wiſe to ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe to ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for ſuch as are inlightned, and converted to God, even thoſe of them that are endued with the greateſt meaſure of ſaving knowledge, have need to read the Scriptures daily and diligently, that they may get more knowledge; for the wiſeſt men are imperfect in knowledge. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that he knew but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102523:138"/>Now I know in part, but then I ſhall know even as alſo I am known. David,</hi> who was wiſer then his Enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 98. and had more underſtanding than all his Teachers, verſ. 99. and underſtood more than the Ancients, verſ. 100. doth acknowledge before God that he had much folly and ignorance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.5. <hi>O God thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſs:</hi> Pſal. 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee.</hi> And he prayeth with great earneſtneſs unto God, to give him knowledge and underſtanding, and to teach him his Statutes, as we may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law:</hi> Verſe 33. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes:</hi> Verſ. 34. <hi>Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy Law:</hi> Verſe 125. <hi>I am thy Servant, give me under ſtanding that I may know thy Teſtimonies:</hi> And in many other places. We are commanded to grow in knowledge, as well as in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore ſeeing the Scriptures are the means whereby we get knowledge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104. <hi>Through thy Precepts I get underſtanding:</hi> And the means of increaſing knowledge, verſe 99. <hi>I have more underſtanding than all my Teachers, for thy Teſtimonies are my meditation:</hi> It is neceſſary that they who have the greateſt meaſure of Light and Underſtanding, ſhould read and meditate in the Word of God night and day, that they may grow in knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are ſome ſins which that Light which is in natural men cannot diſcover, without the help of the Word and Spirit of God. As for inſtance: The firſt motions of ſin, though not conſented to, are ſin; for they are tranſgreſſions of the Law, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet:</hi> The Law doth not only
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102523:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſay, Thou ſhalt not conſent to, thou ſhalt not follow or yeild to thy inordinate deſires, but it forbids the motions themſelves, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us he had not known theſe firſt motions (which he calls by the name of luſt) to be ſin, if it had not been for the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the Law; for I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> Not to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, is a great ſin, it is a ſin for which God will damn men at the day of Judgment, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> Now the Light of Nature doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a man that it is a ſin not to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; it is by the Scripture, which holdeth forth the damnable nature of this ſin of not believing in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the onely begotten Son of God.</hi> And by the help of the Spirit that we come to be convinced of the ſin of not believing in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>And when he</hi> (that is, the Spirit, which is the Comforter ſpoken of in the former verſe) <hi>is come, he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment; of Sin, becauſe they believe not in me.</hi> And as there are ſome ſins of which natural Light doth not convince a man; ſo thoſe ſins of which it doth convince a man, it doth not convince with ſuch clearneſs and power as the Law doth, which ſtops a mans mouth, and makes him fall down before God as as a loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Now we know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God: — By the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are ſeveral Points of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102523:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>of great moment, which that Light that is in natural men diſcovereth not, neither can we know them any other ways, but by the help of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by immediate Revelation from God. As for inſtance: To know and believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> is the promiſed Meſſiah, is of ſuch moment, as that we can't be ſaved unleſs we believe him to be the Meſſiah, <hi>John</hi> 8.24. <hi>I ſaid therefore unto you, That ye ſhall die in your ſins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> Now this knowledge, Fleſh and Blood, Nature in its higheſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot attain, it muſt either be by Revelation from God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.15, 16, 17. <hi>Whom ſay ye that I am? And Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God: And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven:</hi> Or by the help of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And therefore when <hi>Apollos</hi> would convince the Jews that Jeſus was the Chriſt, he did it by the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.28. <hi>For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi> And this way the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> took alſo, he alledged thoſe Scriptures that ſpoke of the Meſſiah, and explained them, and thereby proved to them that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was Chriſt: <hi>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reaſoned with them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again from the dead, and that this Jeſus whom I preach unto you, is Chriſt.</hi> It is of great moment to know what that Righteouſneſs is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Sinner ſhould come to be juſtified in the ſight of God: If a man be ignorant of this Righteouſneſs, he will ſeek to eſtabliſh his own, and will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102523:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſs, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> The Light of Nature cannot find out this Righteouſneſs, it is no where revealed but in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek; for therein is the Righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The Juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> That there are Three Perſons, and yet but One God, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed in the Scriptures, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe Three are One.</hi> But without the help of the Scriptures, the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can attain to but little or no knowledge of this great Myſtery. And as there are ſome Doctrines, ſo alſo ſome Duties in the Chriſtian Religion, which the Light of Nature cannot diſcover. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Baptizing of perſons with water, in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, is an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, which he would have continued, and with which he will afford his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, 19, 20. So alſo is eating Bread, and drinking Wine, in the Lords Supper, and Ordinance of Chriſt, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church till his coming to Judgment; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> But natural Light doth not teach a man that it is his duty to be baptized, or to receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: It is from the Scriptures we learn that Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the uſe of theſe Ordinances is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102523:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be continued in the Church of Chriſt to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Light which we muſt attend unto, and follow, and by which we muſt order our Lives and Converſations, is the Mind and Will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place; until the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Obſerve here,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Light to which the Apoſtle would have us take heed, and ſaith they do well who take heed to it, is the Word of Prophecy; by the Word of Prophecy, he underſtands the Scriptures, which were written, and delivered to us by the Prophets, as is evident from the enſuing word, <hi>Knowing this firſt, that no Prophecy of the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is our duty to take heed to the word of Prophecy, as long as we live in this world; <hi>Whereunto ye do well to take heed,—until the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts:</hi> By the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar is meant Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. <hi>I am the bright and morning Star:</hi> By the Day, is not meant only or chiefly the day of Grace, or the day of the Goſpel, for theſe days had already dawned upon thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the Apoſtle wrot this Epiſtle, for he ſaith of them, <hi>They knew and were eſtabliſhed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent truth,</hi> verſ. 12. They were not only acquainted with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, but were in a ſtate of Grace; they had Faith, as precious Faith as the Apoſtle himſelf who wrote this Epiſtle, verſ. 1. <hi>To them that have obtained like precious Faith with us.</hi>— But by the dawning of the Day, is meant the Day of Glory, which is called the Day of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. and by way of Emphaſis, <hi>That
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102523:140"/>Day,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. And by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in this ſame Epiſtle, Chap. 3.12. <hi>The Day of the Lord.</hi> It is the dawning of this day that the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God long for, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the day break, and the ſhadows flee away: turn my Beloved, and be thou like a Roe or a young Hart upon the mountains of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Rev. 22.20. <hi>Surely I come quickly, Amen: Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> By the Day-Star ariſing in their hearts, is meant their full and immediate fruition of the Lord Jeſus in the Kingdom of Heaven; for they having like precious Faith with the Apoſtle, had this Day-ſtar the Lord Jeſus already dwelling in their hearts by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of what they had already, but of what they ſhould attain unto hereafter, which is their full and immediate enjoyment of Chriſt in Heaven. Our entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, may well be ſet out by this Phraſe, the Day-ſtar ariſing in our hearts, becauſe when we come to heaven there ſhall be great Glory revealed in us, as well as given to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> And the reaſon why the Saints deſire to be in Heaven, is, That they may be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> The World may well be ſtiled a dark place, in oppoſition to the Kingdom of Heaven, which is called by the Name of Light; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. —<hi>The Inheritance of the Saints in Light;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt places and perſons in the world are full of Ignorance and Darkneſs: In the Pſalmiſts days, all places of the earth, except the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were dark places; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20. <hi>The dark places of the earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty.</hi> And in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102523:141"/>
                     <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was a Land of Viſion, the Prophet complains, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>There is no knowledge of God in the Land.</hi> Now as long as we are in this dark place, the World, where we are compaſſed about with much ignorance, we ſhall do well to take heed to the word of Prophecv which the Lord hath given us, as a Light to guide and direct our paths, till the Day of Glory dawn upon us, and we are taken up into the Kingdom of Heaven, where there ſhall be no need of the Sun, or Moon, or any Temple, but the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, ſhall be the Light of His People for ever, <hi>Revelat.</hi> 21. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve, That we cannot have a more ſure Rule to guide us, either in matters of Faith or Practice, than the holy Scriptures. What do we deſire to guide and direct us what we ſhould believe, or what we ſhould practiſe? Do we deſire a Viſion, a Revelation, a Voice from Heaven? The Word of Prophecy is as ſure as theſe; Yea, the Apoſtle having been ſpeaking of a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, gives the preheminence to the Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and ſaith, <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> — Beſides this place which I have already produced to prove that the Light to which we muſt attend, and by which we muſt order our Lives and Converſations, is the Mind and Will of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures; I might mention ſeveral others, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light:</hi> Pſal. 119.105. <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a Light unto my path.</hi> The ſame alſo may be gathered from the diſcourſe of Chriſt with the Lawyer, and of <hi>Abraham</hi> with the rich man that was in Hell-Torments, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.25, 26, 27, 28. There came a man to Jeſus Chriſt, and asked
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102523:141"/>him this queſtion, <hi>Maſter what ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> And whether doth Chriſt ſend him for direction? To the Scriptures: <hi>He ſaid unto him, What is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the man tells Chriſt what he had found written, and what he had read in the Law; <hi>And he anſwering ſaid, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind; and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> To which Chriſt gives him this anſwer, <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Thou haſt anſwered right; this do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Whence we may infer, That reading the Scriptures, and practiſing what we read, will guide us into the right way that leads to everlaſting life. When the Rich Man, who was tormented in Hell, pleaded with <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> to his Brethren, to preach to them, that they might not come into that place of torment; what anſwer did <hi>Abraham</hi> give him? Did he tell them, They had a Light in them, if they did follow that, it would lead them to Repentance and Salvation? No, he refers them to the Scriptures, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.29. <hi>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> He doth not mean they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets alive, and converſing amongſt them in their own perſons, but they had the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and they were to attend to them, and adds moreover, If the Scriptures that were written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets would not lead them to Repentance, the coming of one from the dead would not work upon them, verſe 31. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The danger of neglecting the Scriptures, and following our own Light, without looking to, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102523:142"/>regulating our apprehenſions by the word of God, may be further evidenced from the fallible nature of our underſtandings: We are all of us, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubject to many and great miſtakes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>'David</hi> cried out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errours?</hi> We are ſubject to ſuch great miſtakes, that a man that walks (as he thinks) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Light, may commit hainous ſins, when he is peſrwaded in his mind that he doth nothing but what he is bound in conſcience to do. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the Members of Chriſt, he did not do it from malice, or to pleaſe the Jews, or to get preferment; but he followed his Light, he thought verily that it was his duty to oppoſe the ways and Members of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> A man may be ſo far miſtaken, as that he may think he doth God good ſervice, when he is committing abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins. It is an abominable ſin to kill the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, yet ſome mens light doth ſo far miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide them, as that they think they do God ſervice, when they kill his ſervants, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>Yea the time cometh, that whoſoever kelleth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> A man may verily think that his ways are right and good, and yet they may be ſuch as will lead him to deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.12. <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the ways of death.</hi> And therefore we find God charging us not to lean to our own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Lean not unto thine own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> And commanding us to obſerve his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and not to do ſuch things as are right in our own eyes; <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.1, 8. <hi>Theſe are the Statutes and Judgments which ye ſhall obſerve to do:
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102523:142"/>—ye ſhall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatſoever is right in his own eyes.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. Satan can transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, and ſuggeſt his own evil motions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name and notion of the dictates and motions of the Spirit of God: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light.</hi> And becauſe Satan can transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and make as if he were an Angel of Light, we are commanded not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they be of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God.</hi> And by what ſhall we try the Spirits, whether they be of God? This muſt be done by the VVord of God; we muſt have recourſe to the Law and Teſtimonies; what is agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we muſt own as the Will of God; what is contrary to them, we muſt reject, as coming from the Spirit of Deluſion. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> VVhatever Light or Spirit would draw us off from, or perſwade us to any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>This Word,</hi> that is, the <hi>Law and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> is to be rejected, as no true Light, nor true Spirit.</p>

It is the ſame word which is uſed <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>I am he which ſearcheth the heart and reins:</hi> Such a ſearch ſhould we make into the Scriptures, we ſhould labour to have a clear and thorow underſtanding of the moſt abſtruſe and hidden truths, that are wrapped up in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It is not only our duty to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to do it daily, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they received the Word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily.</hi> And to continue reading ſome portion of them every day, as long as we live, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. —<hi>He ſhall write him a copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prieſts the Levites, and it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life.</hi> This is ſpoken of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and if they were obliged to get a Copy of the Law, and to read therein all their days, then ſurely other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour perſons, that have nothing ſo much buſineſs upon their hands as Kings, are obliged to ſpare ſome time every day, from their occaſions, to read ſome portion of the Scriptures. Beſides our reading the Scriptures privately by our ſelves, God commandeth them to be read publickly in the audience of all the people, both Men, and Women, and Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12. And we find it was the practiſe of the ſervants of God in their publick Aſſemblies, to read the Scriptures, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.34, 35. <hi>He read all the words of the Law, the Bleſſings and Curſings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law; there was not a word that Moſes commanded, which Joſhua read not before all the Congregation of Iſrael, with the women, and their little ones, and the ſtrangers that were converſant among them.</hi> And this they did not at ſome extraordinary times only, but it was their conſtant courſe to read
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102523:143"/>the Scriptures in their Aſſemblies every Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13, 22. <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City thens that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</hi> And our Lord Jeſus approved this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by his own example, he read the Scriptures to the Jews on the Sabbath days, <hi>Luc.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and as his cuſtom was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and ſtood up for to read, and there was delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the Book of the Prophet Eſaias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. As all ſorts of perſons are commanded to read the Scriptures, ſo all ſorts of perſons may reap great benefit by reading the Scriptures; Men, VVomen, Children, Strangers, all ſorts of people may learn to fear and obey the Lord, by reading the word of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael, Gather the people together, Men, Women, and Children, and the Stranger that is within thy Gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and obſerve to do all the words of this Law.</hi> Reading the Scriptures is an effectual means to beget Repentance, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8, 9. <hi>So they read in the Book, in the Law of God diſtinctly, and gave the ſenſe, and cauſed them to underſtand the reading— All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wept when they heard the words of the Law:</hi> And Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>They received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo; Therefore many of them believed.</hi> The Lord hath promiſed his Bleſſing to thoſe that read and practiſe thoſe things which are written in the Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the Words of this Prophecy, and keep thoſe things which are written therein.</hi>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102523:144"/>the Commandments of God, and this is one of the Commandments of God, which he doth often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate upon us, That we ſhould teach his word unto our Children, and train them up in the knowledge and obedience of his Laws, as hath been already proved from <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Theſe words which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy Children:</hi> Pſal. 78.5. <hi>He eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children:</hi> Epheſ. 6.4. <hi>And ye Fathers provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> And ſeveral other places. So that if we would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our Light which we have received from Gods word, that will teach us to inſtruct our Children di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in the knowledge of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The great ignorance and folly which is in Children, ſhews that they have need of more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, than to be called upon to follow the Light that is in them; for how little Light have Children before they are inſtructed? God commands his word to be read to Children, and why? <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael, in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Gather the People together, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren— And that their Children which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the Land whither ye go to poſſeſs.</hi> See here how little knowledge is aſcribed unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ——<hi>That their Children which have not known any thing.</hi>— Obſerve alſo what means God preſcribes for the bringing Children to know and fear the Lord, and that is, reading his Law to them; <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael in their hearing, that their Children—may hear, and learn to fear the Lord.</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102523:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>Inſtead of knowledge, there is folly in our Children, and this folly is bound up ſo faſt in their hearts, that it cannot be fetch'd out without inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Hear inſtruction, and be wiſe:</hi> Neither will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction do it alone, unleſs correction be joyned with inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a Child, but the Rod of Correction will drive it far from him:</hi> Prov. 29.15. <hi>The Rod and Reproof give wiſdom:</hi> But how will that Child prove, that is left to himſelf, and hath neither inſtruction nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? The next words will inform us; <hi>But a Child left to himſelf bringeth his Mother to ſhame.</hi> As he that refuſeth to receive inſtruction, regardeth not, but deſpiſeth his own Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.32. <hi>He that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own Soul:</hi> So he that refuſeth to give inſtruction to his Children, may be ſaid to deſpiſe the ſouls of his Children.

                     <hi>WE ſee many Children and Servants that have good inſtructions, prove very vile and corrupt, and are never a whit the better, but rather the worſe for all the pains that is taken with them, and therefore it is to no purpoſe for us to inſtruct our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though ſome are never a whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the inſtructions and good counſels which are given them, yet others are converted to God, and edified thereby. And who can tell but God may bleſs your labour unto the Converſion and Salvation of thoſe that are under your Charge?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If any means under Heaven will do them good, inſtructing them out of the word of God, is the moſt likely way and means to lead them to Repentance: We think if a damned Soul ſhould come out of Hell, and declare what torments it hath felt in Hell, or a Saint ſhould come out of Heaven, and declare what Joys he hath poſſeſs'd in Heaven, this would work
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102523:147"/>wonderfully upon our Children, towards the leading of them to Repentance; but the word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures, will do more towards the bringing men to Repentance, then the riſing of one from the dead would do, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.29, 30, 31. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them: And he ſaid, Nay father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent. And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one riſe from the dead.</hi> If the Scriptures will not perſwade men to repent and believe, ſuch men would not repent and believe, though Jeſus Chriſt himſelf were on earth to ſpeak to them; <hi>John</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>Had ye believed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me; but if ye believe not his writings, how ſhall ye believe my words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you ſhould not convert your Children and Servants, but they ſhould ſtill go on in their evil ways, yet it is worth your time and pains to inſtruct and warn them of the danger they are in by reaſon of ſin, for hereby you ſhall deliver your own ſouls from being guilty of their Blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.19. <hi>If thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The word of God is to ſome men the ſavour of death unto death; yet the Miniſters of Chriſt muſt not ceaſe to preach the word, becauſe all that hear them are not converted from their evil ways. And when they diſcharge their work and duty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, they are a ſweet ſavour unto God in thoſe that periſh, as well as in them that are ſaved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>We are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh; to the one we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102523:147"/>are the ſavour of death unto death, and to the other the ſavour of life unto life.</hi> So it is with Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, they muſt not deſiſt from Family-Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they ſhould ſee their Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants continuing in their ſins, for if they diſcharge their duty faithfully, and with diligence, though they ſhould have no ſucceſs, they ſhall be accepted of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

Thus our Lord Jeſus inſtructed his Diſciples; he did not only quote Scriptures out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to prove that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he muſt ſuffer before he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he expounded the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.27. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> And this opening of the Scriptures which he produced, did much affect their hearts, verſ. 32. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us,—while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> The Eunuch who was a man of great Authority under <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and had the charge of all her treaſure, (and if he had not been a wiſe man, it is probable he would not have been placed in ſo great authority) who was alſo a devout man, and came as far as <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to worſhip God, acknowledged that he could not underſtand the Scriptures without being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the ſenſe and meaning of what he read: when he was reading in the Prophet <hi>Eſaias,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt? He ſaid unto him, How can I, except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> Acts 8.27, 30, 31. If ſuch a great man, ſuch a devout man as this Eunuch was, needed one to guide him into the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102523:153"/>of the Scriptures, what need have our Children and Servants of having thoſe Scriptures wherein they are inſtructed, opened and explained to them.</p>
                  <p>III. Endeavour to fix thoſe things in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which you teach them, by cauſing them often to rehearſe thoſe portions of Scripture wherein they have been inſtructed. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they whom he inſtructed might keep what he had taught them always in remembrance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Moreover I will endeavour that you may be able af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my deceaſe to have theſe things always in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> So ſhould you labour to imprint thoſe things in their memories which you teach your Children, that after you are dead, and can inſtruct them no more, they may remember what you have taught while you lived with them.</p>
                  <p>IV. Apply the Word of God to them, when you read the Scriptures in your Families, as the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> did his Meſſage that he delivered to the Prieſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>And now, O ye Prieſts, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is for you; if ye will not hear, if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my Name, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi> Whether it be a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or Promiſe, or Threatning, or an Example of Gods Judgments on ſinners, or of his bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on his ſervants, tell them, That <hi>theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, O my Children, the great God that made you, and that will bring you to Judgment, hath given to you; if you obey them, he will love you and bleſs you, and give you all good things in this world, and great bleſſings in the world to come: But if you will not hearken to his Voice, but caſt his Law behind your backs, he will ſend many heavy Judgments and great Plagues upon you in this world, and if they do not lead you to repentance, he will
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102523:153"/>caſt you both Body and Soul into Hell Fire.</hi> And ſo for the Promiſes, tell them, <hi>Theſe great and precious Promiſes ſhall be your portion, if you will believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and live holy and godly lives,</hi> Gal. 3.22. 1 Tim. 4.8. Do the like by the Threatnings, tell them, <hi>That theſe will ſurely be executed on them, if they live in thoſe-ſins againſt which ſuch and ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are threatned: For GOD is faithful, and able to perform his Word, and is no Reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and there is no lying hid from his all-ſeeing Eye, nor any poſſibility to eſcape out of His Hand.</hi> VVhen you meet with Examples of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on impenitent ſinners, tell them, <hi>Thoſe Examples are recorded on purpoſe to keep them from falling into ſuch ſins,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.5, 6. <hi>and to lead them to Repentance,</hi> Luk. 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>And that if they live in the ſame ſins, they muſt expect to meet with the ſame Judgments.</hi> And ſo alſo the Examples of Gods mercies towards his ſervants, tell them, <hi>That if they will ſerve God, the ſame mercies and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God gave</hi> Abraham, <hi>or</hi> David, <hi>or any other of his ſervants, he will give them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of theſe things I have ſpoken before more largely in the Third Chapter, and it will be needleſs to repeat them again. By what hath been ſaid there, it is evident that there is much more work lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Parents beſides teaching them to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as, VVatching over them, Reproof, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>WE may teach our Children to know and remember the Scriptures, but we can't teach them obedience, that is Gods work; and what good will it do them to know and remember the Word, if they do not obey it? And beſides, if they ſhould whilſt they are young walk in the ways of God, they will forſake them when they grow old, and be the worſe for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and make good the old Proverb,</hi> A young Saint, and an old Devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is true, that it is Gods work to teach our Children Obedience, but we muſt uſe the means. Shall the Miniſters of the Goſpel forbear preaching the word, becauſe the converſion of ſouls is Gods work, not theirs?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God doth ordinarily bleſs the Endeavours of Parents and Maſters of Families, when they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and faithful in their work, not only to the breeding of knowledge, but alſo to the bringing of their Children and Servants to obey the Lord, and walk in his ways, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>He will command his Children and Houſhould after him, and they SHALL keep the way of the Lord to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi>— Here God promiſeth that upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Children and Houſhold, they ſhould keep the way of the Lord. And what God promiſeth to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he promiſeth and will peform unto all that walk in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſteps. If perſons that have had Religious Education, would conſult their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, they will find that generally God inſtils
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102523:154"/>Principles of Grace into ſuch as are converted, by means of their Religious Education.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Proverb, <hi>A young Saint and an old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> was of Satans coining, to deter perſons from ſeeking and ſerving the Lord, for it is contrary to the word of God, for that ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> None prove ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints as they that begin to ſeek and ſerve the Lord whilſt they are young. I will give two or three inſtances hereof: <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a very humble tender-hearted Prince, he wept at the hearing of Gods Law, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.18, 19. He was very zealous in the Reformation of Religion, and deſtroying Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Chap. xxiii. ver. 1. to 25. There never was ſuch a Paſſover kept either in the days of the Judges, or of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> as <hi>Joſiah</hi> kept, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.22, 23. He excelled all the Kings that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and all that came after him, verſe 25. <hi>And like unto him there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes, neither after him aroſe there any like him.</hi> And as he was thus eminent in Godlineſs, ſo he continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his dying day: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.2. <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his Father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor left.</hi> And one reaſon why he proved ſo eminent and conſtant in the ways of God, was this, He began while he was young to ſeek after the Lord, as is expreſſed in the following verſe, <hi>For in the eighth year of his Reign, while he was yet young, he began to ſeek after the God of David his Father. Obadiah,</hi> who feared the Lord from his youth, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.12. <hi>I thy Servant fear the Lord from my youth;</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102523:155"/>unto a great meaſure of the fear of God, verſe 3. <hi>Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly:</hi> He kept his Integrity though he lived in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Houſe, who was ſuch a wicked Prince, that he did ſell himſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord. He was a great ſhelter to the Lords Prophets when they were perſecuted, and ſome of them put to death by <hi>Jezabel,</hi> he hid an hundred Prophets in a Cave, and maintained them with Bread and VVater, verſe 4. <hi>David</hi> began to ſeek and truſt in God while he was young, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.5. <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou art my Truſt from my youth:</hi> And we know he proved a man after Gods own heart, the inſtances of his exemplary piety are ſo many, that it would be too long, and ſo well known, that it would be needleſs to mention them.</p>

It is a grievous ſlander to ſay, None of your Neighbours take any care of their Families to teach them to know and ſerve the Lord, it is in effect to ſay they are as bad or worſe than Infidels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any provide not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> The Soul is of far greater value than the Body, and if ſo, then the neglecting to provide for the Souls of thoſe of our own Houſe, is a greater ſin than the neglecting to provide for their Bodies.

                  <p>In times of diſtreſs God is wont to open mens ears to diſcipline, which are ſhut againſt good counſel in the day of proſperity; <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 10. <hi>If they be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the cords of affliction, he openeth their ear to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> When there were mighty thundrings and lightnings in the Land of <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh</hi> though he was a man of a hard heart, ſent for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and humbled himſelf for his ſins, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their prayers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27, 28. The Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> likeneth unruly perſons that will not liſten to and obey ſuch Inſtructions as are given them out of the word, unto the wild Aſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. <hi>A wild Aſs uſed to the Wilderneſs, that ſnuffeth up the wind at her pleaſure, in her occaſion who can turn her away? All they that ſeek her, will not weary themſelves: In her month they ſhall find her.</hi> As the wild Aſs that is uſed to the wilderneſs wanders up and down at her pleaſure, and cannot be tamed till her month come; that is, till ſhe grows big with young, and is weary and heavy pained with the burden that ſhe carries, and then it is eaſie to find her out, and deal with her. So it is with ſome ſinners, though they be as wild and as unruly as the Aſs that is uſed to the Wilderneſs, and there is no turning of them whilſt they are in their proſperity, and when they have their occaſions and opportunities of ſinning; yet when their month comes, when they are burdened with afflictions, and involved in ſuch ſtreights &amp; difficulties, that they cannot tell what to do to wind out of them, then it is eaſie having acceſs to them. Wherefore if you have unruly Servants, or unruly Children, watch your ſeaſons to deal with them; and when God ſtrikes fear and terrour into their hearts by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, do you ſtrike in with your inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you cannot do any good to them by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102523:158"/>endeavour to win them to Chriſt by a pious, heavenly, exemplary converſation. There is great force in a godly converſation, to gain upon ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſtand out againſt and ſhew much oppoſition to the word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Likewiſe ye Wives be in ſubjection to your own Husbands; that if any obey not the Word, they alſo may without the Word be won by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Wives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Deſire ſome godly Miniſters to deal with them, if you cannot prevail with them your ſelves to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to inſtruction. It may be God will bleſs the Counſel, the Reproof, the Exhortations that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhall give your Children and Servants, if you make known your cafe to them, and deſire them to deal with your Families, and to convince them out of Gods word that it is their duty, and will conduce much unto their good, to ſubmit to inſtruction. It is ſaid of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was one of Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. <hi>He ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the Diſobedient to the wiſdom of the Juſt.</hi> And the like is promiſed <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He ſhall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the hearts of the Children to the Fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the Earth with a Curſe.</hi> And what was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> the ſame good effect may we expect from the endeavours of other godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, namely, that God will bleſs their labours to the converſion of our Children.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If they be your Children that refuſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, correct them. The Rod may do that which words will not do. <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth to apply the Rod to ſuch as are fools, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.3. — <hi>A Rod for the fools back.</hi> Now if you would know whom he accounts fools, you ſhall find they are ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102523:159"/>and deſpiſe inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.5. <hi>A fool deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his fathers inſtruction:</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Fools de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction.</hi> Now the Rod of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection will fetch this folly out of the hearts of your Children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. If they be your Servants that refuſe inſtruction, as ſoon as you can with a good conſcience, diſmiſs them from your ſervice. <hi>David's</hi> care was to get good Servants, and if any of them proved vitious, and would not be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he caſt them out of his Family, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6, 7. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me; he that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell within my Houſe; he that telleth lies, ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> Imitate this example of <hi>David,</hi> get godly Servants, or at leaſt endeavour to make them godly after they are come under your Roof; and if they be ſuch as will not be inſtructed and reformed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; and make this Covenant with all that you ſhall admit for time to come, That they ſubmit unto inſtruction.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If there be no ſucceſs of your Labours in your Family, ſee if the cauſe be not in your
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102523:159"/>ſelves: Do you water your ſeed that you ſow with your Prayers and Tears? Do you wraſtle with God for a bleſſing? Are you fervent in prayer for the converſion and edification of ſuch as are under your charge? Do you ſhew a good example to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and walk convincingly before them, and teach them by your converſation? Do you go about this work in the Name of the Lord, relying on his ſtrength, and depending on his aſſiſtance, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his preſence with you? Do you watch over their Converſations, as well as teach them? Do you reprove and correct your Children when they walk contrary to the word of God? Do you inſtruct your Families diligently, ſeriouſly, frequently? Or is this work done but ſeldom, and in a ſlight manner? Do you labour to know their ſtate, and to apply that which is ſuitable to them, and profitable for them? If the ground and cauſe why you have no better ſucceſs, be in your ſelves, reform that which hinders your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and you ſhall ſoon find the bleſſing of God going along with your Labours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the cauſe of your Families unproſitableneſs lie in themſelves; 1. Shew them what a great ſin, and how dangerous it is, to be unprofitable under the means of grace; and turn them to ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. &amp; 25.30. <hi>Luc.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7, 8. and preſs them home upon their conſciences. 2.

Direct.</hi> 15. <hi>pag.</hi> 165.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may be good ſucceſs of your Labours though you perceive it not; the Lord may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ſeed of grace into their Souls, by your Inſtruction, though you diſcover it not; and it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102523:160"/>may grow, though you diſcern it not; <hi>Mark</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how.</hi> God many times diſtils his Grace like dew, in a ſilent inſenſible manner, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your want of ſucceſs ſhould be ſo far from cauſing you to deſiſt from this work of Family-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that it ſhould ſtir you up to ply your work with greater diligence, and cauſe you to abound in actings of faith upon thoſe Promiſes where the Lord hath promiſed to bleſs and proſper his peoples la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I will mention three or four to this purpoſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.22, 23. <hi>Mine Elect ſhall long enjoy the work of their hands, they ſhall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble:</hi> Pſal. 1.3. <hi>Whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, 16. <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to doctrine: Take heed to thy ſelf, unto thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, continue in them, for in doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee.</hi> Deut. 15.10. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in all thy works, and in all that thou putteſt thine hand unto.</hi> The leſs ſucceſs and bleſſing you find attending your labours, be the more earneſt in pleading ſuch Promiſes as theſe are, and the more abundant in acting faith upon them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though you can't ſee any fruit of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours either in the converſion or edification of any that are under your charge, but do apprehend that your labour hath hitherto been in vain, yet you muſt not deſiſt from this good work of teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing your Families, but continue therein as long as you live. And that you may not ſit down under diſcouragement and give over inſtructing your Families, becauſe you do not find ſucceſs in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102523:160"/>your work; Let me propoſe to you theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>I. Conſider that God often renews and repeats the ſame means and ways to bring about our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though former means have not prevailed with us to lead us to repentance, <hi>Job</hi> 33.29, 30. <hi>Lo all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his Soul from the Pit, to be inlightned with the light of the Living.</hi> God takes great pains with one and the ſame man, to bring back his Soul from the Pit; <hi>He worketh,</hi> He doth not only call, or counſel and perſwade, but <hi>He worketh, theſe things, all theſe things;</hi> that is, He worketh by his Word, v. 23. and by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Providences, Mercies, Afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the fore-going verſes; and not only once or twice, but <hi>oftentimes:</hi> And there is a note of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention prefixed to this, that we may give the greater heed to it, <hi>LO!</hi> Now if God taketh great pains, and worketh oftentimes by the ſame ways and means, with one and the ſame man, to bring back his Soul from the Pit, ſhall we think much day by day to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our Families, and to continue ſo doing, that we may be inſtrumental to ſave their Souls, though hitherto we have ſeen no ſucceſs of our Labours?</p>
                  <p>II. Though you ſee no fruit of your labours for the preſent, yet you may do before you die, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Let us not be weary of well doing, for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi> Yea though you ſhould ſee none whilſt you live, yet after you are dead, your Children may remember what you taught them whilſt you lived, and may thereby be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and repent of their ſins. After Chriſt was dead, his Diſciples were much helped in their faith by calling to remembrance what he had taught them in his life-time: <hi>John</hi> 2.22. <hi>When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102523:161"/>he was riſen from the dead, his Diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them; and they believed the Scriptures, and the word which Jeſus had ſpoken.</hi> Though the Seed of the Word ſeem to lie dead in their hearts for the preſent, yet poſſibly God may quicken it by ſome affliction. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah's</hi> Son, and ſo doubtleſs had good inſtructions from his Father, but yet he proved very vitious, till he came into affliction; he ſhed much innocent blood, he dealt with a familiar ſpirit, and with wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and uſed inchantments and witchcrafts, he was a great Idolater, and built Altars for all the hoſt of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the Lord brought him into affliction, he humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and was brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11, 12, 13. It is probable that there is mention made of his humbling himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of his Fathers, to ſhew that his Fathers Inſtructions were inſtrumental to bring him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when he was in his affliction.</p>
                  <p>III. Though you ſhould not convert your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants by the inſtructions which you give them out of the word of God, yet poſſibly what you do may prepare them for the Miniſtry of the Word; the Seed you have ſown may be quickned by the Miniſtry of the Word to their converſion and ſalvation. And this is no ſmall mercy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to plow up the fallow ground, and to prepare the hearts of your Children and Servants, for the publick Miniſtry of the Word. All that heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> were not brought to believe in Chriſt, yet was not <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s labour in vain, for <hi>John</hi>'s Labours did prepare them for Chriſt; and when they came to hear Chriſt, the remembring what they had heard from <hi>John,</hi> did help them to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102523:161"/>believe in Chriſt, as we may ſee <hi>John</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. <hi>And Jeſus went away again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at firſt baptized, and there he abode; and many reſorted to him, and ſaid, John did no miracle, but all things that John ſpake of this man were true. And many believed on him there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. Conſider what pains the Husbandman takes in tilling the Earth, and what long patience he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth before he reaps any fruit of his Labours: He ploweth often in order to the fitting and preparing the Earth to receive the Seed, and after his Seed is ſowen it lieth buried under the ground, and for a ſeaſon nothing appears; after his Seed cometh up, it is a long time to the Harveſt; and many times by unſeaſonable weather, either immoderate Rain, or Drought, or Blaſting, or Mildew, all his Labour is loſt: Yet he renews his labour again year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter year, as long as he liveth, and ploweth and ſoweth his ground, in hope of the bleſſing of God. The Apoſtle puts us in mind of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans patience, to make us patient in waiting for better things, <hi>James</hi> 5.7. <hi>Be patient therefore Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord; Behold the Husbandman waiteth for the precious Fruit of the Earth, and hath long patience for it, until he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the early and latter Rain.</hi> What though you ſee no fruit after much pains taken with your Families? And after ſome appearance of fruit, there comes a blaſting of your hopes, yet you muſt renew your Labours day after day, hoping that at length God will bleſs your endeavours. The fruit of inſtruction in the converſion and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your Families, is much better than the fruits of the earth, and is worthy of more pains and patience than the Husbandman exerciſeth for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruits of the earth.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102523:162"/>Remember therefore and follow the counſel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand; for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this or that, or whether they both ſhall be alike good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. Though you ſhould not convert the Souls of your Children and Servants, yet you muſt go on to inſtruct them, for in ſo doing you ſhall deliver your own Soul, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.19. <hi>If thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul:</hi> And ſhall be clear from their blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.26, 27. <hi>I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſel of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VI. Though you ſhould take much pains in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing your Families, and ſhould be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to convert none of them, yet your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord; for you ſhall have a great Reward from God: Your Reward ſhall be according to your work and pains that you have taken, not according to your ſucceſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my Reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi> As it is with the Miniſters of Chriſt, if they have taught the people diligently and faithfully the good word of the Lord, though they have not converted them, they ſhall have their Reward from God, and be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5. <hi>Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for naught and in vain; yet ſurely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work</hi> (or as it is in the Margin, <hi>my Reward</hi>) <hi>with my God—Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102523:162"/>Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> So alſo it ſhall be with Maſters of Families.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore do not give over this work through any diſcouragement, but be ſtedfaſt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, always abounding therein, inaſmuch as you know that your labour ſhall not be in vain; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what you find recorded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Therefore my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, always abounding in the work of the Lord: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>

THough our Children and Servants whom we have inſtructed, and for whom we have prayed, ſhould prove very vile and wicked, yet we ſhould hope as long as we and they live, that God in his due time may hear our Prayers, and bleſs our Endeavours for the converſion of their Souls, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:102523:163"/>9.4. <hi>For to him that is joyned to all the Living, there is hope.</hi> The Lord ſometimes gives Repentance unto Life, to the worſt of men, to ſuch as are the Devils ſlaves, and ſuch as are taken captive by him at his will, and to ſuch as do oppoſe the means of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. And as God calls ſome of the chiefeſt Sinners, ſo he calls ſome towards the latter end of their days. Some were called into the Vineyard at the eleventh hour of the day, when they had ſpent all the day in idleneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others ſtanding idle, and ſaith unto them, Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? — Go ye alſo into the Vineyard</hi>— If we ſhould die before them, and ſee them continuing in their ſins till our dying day, yet as <hi>Noah,</hi> though he foreſaw that the Gentiles who were the poſterity of <hi>Japheth, Gen.</hi> 10.1, 5. would continue a long time in their eſtrangement from God, yet he hoped that God in due time would convert them, and cauſe them to embrace the true Religion, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Off-ſpring of <hi>Shem,</hi> Gen. 9.27. <hi>God ſhall enlarge</hi> (or as the word may be render'd, <hi>God ſhall perſwade</hi>) <hi>Japheth, and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem.</hi> So ſhould we hope concerning our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that God will perſwade their hearts to repent of their ſins, though we ſhould ſee them go on in evil and deſtructive courſes a long time together, and that becauſe of his promiſe to circumciſe not only our hearts, but the hearts alſo of our Seed to love him with all our hearts, and all our ſouls, that both we and they may have everlaſting life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
                  <p>2. If after all our prayers, and tears, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and endeavours after their ſalvation, we ſhould ſee any of our Children or Servants live and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102523:164"/>die in ſuch a condition as that we could have no hope of their ſalvation, we may quiet our minds with ſuch conſiderations as theſe:</p>
                  <p>I. Conſider Gods Soveraignty: He hath a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power over all his Creatures, to diſpoſe of their temporal and ſpiritual eſtate according to his own pleaſure; we are in Gods hand as clay in the hands of the Potter, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6. <hi>O Houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as this Potter, ſaith the Lord?

All Creatures in Heaven, and in the Earth, and in the Sea, and in all other places, are diſpoſed of by God, according to his will and good pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, and in the Seas, and in all deep places.</hi> And ſhall we think much, or repine againſt God, when he diſpoſeth of our Children, or any other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Family, as ſeemeth good in his ſight. When the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eli, I will judge his Houſe for ever — And I have ſworn unto the Houſe of Eli, That
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102523:164"/>iniquity of Eli's Houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice nor offering for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13, 14. This was ſad tidings, yet when <hi>Eli</hi> conſidered it was the Lord who had power to diſpoſe of him and his Family, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his ſight, he quietly ſubmitted his will to the will of God, verſ. 18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> No Parents did ever thirſt more after the ſalvation of their Childrens Souls, than Jeſus Chriſt thirſted after the ſalvation of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man; yet when he ſaw that it was his Fathers good pleaſure to hide the Myſteries of the Goſpel from ſome perſons who were wiſe and prudent in worldly matters, with whom he had taken much pains in preaching the Goſpel, he reſted abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the will and pleaſure of his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes: Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in thy ſight.</hi> From verſe 19. to 24. Jeſus Chriſt upbraids the Cities wherein moſt of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty works were done, becauſe they repented not, and tells them what an heavy condemnation they ſhould have at the day of Judgment, more dreadful than <hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Sydon,</hi> or <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> And at that time, when he had done upbraiding thoſe Cities, he addreſſeth himſelf to his Father, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his perfect acquieſcence in his Fathers will, <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had hid the Myſteries of the Goſpel from the wiſe and prudent, (and we know that eternal perdition followeth the hiding of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt</hi>) and had revealed them only, or chiefly at leaſt, to ſuch as were in compariſon of the wiſe and prudent
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102523:165"/>men in the world, but <hi>Babes.</hi> Now ſeeing our Lord Jeſus did acquieſce in his Fathers good pleaſure, when he ſaw many amongſt whom he had preached and done his mighty works, continuing in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and impenitent condition, and ſo periſhing eternally; It concerneth us to ſubmit our ſelves to the will and pleaſure of God, if after all the pains that we have taken to convert and ſave our Childrens Souls, he ſhould leave ſome of them to periſh in their ſins. We muſt know that he is God, and ſo may diſpoſe of us, and all that belongs to us, as he pleaſeth, and howſoever he is pleaſed to deal with us, we muſt be ſtill and ſilent under his hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Others as good and better than we, have met with the ſame trial, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome of their children and ſervants have degenerated and proved vicious and lewd perſons, and have lived and died in their ſins, notwithſtanding all the pains that their Parents and Governours have taken to convert and ſave their ſouls. <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Cain,</hi> (who murthered his own brother, and was a fugitive and vagabond in the earth, and hath the brand of a wicked man ſet upon him by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12.) as well as righteous <hi>Abel: Noah</hi> had an <hi>Ham,</hi> who ſaw and divulged his fathers nakedneſs, and had his fathers curſe upon him and his poſterity, as well as a pious <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth:</hi> righteous <hi>Lot</hi> had two daughters that enticed him to drunkenneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt: <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in his younger time was ſo vile, that <hi>Abraham</hi> caſt him out of his family for a ſcoffer; <hi>Iſaac</hi> had a profane <hi>Eſau</hi> who ſold his Birthright for a meſs of Pottage, a man hated of God; <hi>Eſau have I hated,</hi> Rom. 9.13. as well as a godly <hi>Jacob. Jacob</hi> met with croſſes in his Children, <hi>Reuben</hi> his firſt-born
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102523:165"/>defiled his Fathers Bed, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> by their cruelty in ſlaying the <hi>Shechemites</hi> after they had drawn them to be circumciſed, made <hi>Jacob</hi>'s name to ſtink among the Inhabitants of the Land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.30. <hi>Judah</hi> lieth with his Daughter-in-law <hi>Tamar,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her to have been an Harlot, with divers other croſſes in the reſt of his Children, as the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Aaron</hi> loſt two ſons, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> In the very act of ſin, as they were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſtrange fire, fire came from the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them. <hi>Eli</hi>'s children were ſuch ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that their wickedneſs cauſed men to abhor the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12, 17, <hi>David</hi> met with much affliction in his children; <hi>Amnon</hi> raviſhed his ſiſter <hi>Tamar, Abſolom</hi> killed <hi>Amnon</hi> when his heart was merry with wine, <hi>Abſolom</hi> was cut off in the Act of his Rebellion, <hi>Adonijah</hi> ſeeks the Crown which his father had devolved upon his ſon <hi>Solomon.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had a ſelect Family, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twelve Apoſtles, whom he choſe out of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whom he often inſtructed with great power, (<hi>for his word was with power,</hi> Luke 4.32.) and yet one of them proved little better than a devil, <hi>John</hi> 6.70. <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</hi> He proved ſo vile, that he betrayed his Maſter for thirty pieces of ſilver, and then went and hang'd himſelf, and went to his own place. <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet had a lying ſervant, <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who went in his Maſters name, but contrary to his Maſters mind, to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and demanded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for his own uſe a great ſum of money, as much as two men could carry, and two changes of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.20, 21, 22, 23. Theſe examples, with ſeveral others which might be produced, do ſhew that though it be a great affliction to have evil
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102523:166"/>children and evil ſervants, yet it is a temptation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men, even to good men, yea ſuch as have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen the beſt men that ever lived upon the face of the earth, whoſe perſons have been very dear and precious in the ſight of God, and their works and labours have been graciouſly accepted of him. And therefore we ſhould not be diſquieted or caſt down without meaſure, becauſe God doth not bleſs our labours with the converting and ſaving of all the members of our families, neither ſhould we conclude from hence that either our perſons or our labours are not accepted with God.</p>
                  <p>III. Our children are <hi>Gods creatures</hi> as well as <hi>our children:</hi> God hath a greater right to them, and a greater intereſt in them, than we have. We were but Gods inſtruments to bring them into the world: It was (not we, but) God created and gave them their beings, it was Gods hands that framed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned their Bodies when they lay in their Mothers womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Thy hands have made and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me:</hi> 1 Cor. 12.24. <hi>God hath tempered the body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> It is God that gave them every part of their Bodies, as Skin, and Bones, and Fleſh, and Sinews; <hi>Job</hi> 10.11. <hi>Thou haſt clothed me with skin and fleſh, and haſt fenced me with bones and ſinews:</hi> And every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Bodies, as Eyes, Hands, Feet, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 139.16. <hi>Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and in thy Book all my members were written, which in continuance were faſhioned, whenas yet there was none of them.</hi> It was God which created their Souls, after he had formed their Bodies, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1.—<hi>Saith the Lord, which ſtretcheth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundation of the Earth, and formeth the Spirit of Man within him:</hi> Ezek. 18.4. <hi>Behold all Souls are mine; as the Soul of the Father, ſo alſo the Soul of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102523:166"/>Son is mine; the Soul that ſinneth ſhall die:</hi> It was God that drew them out of the womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Thou art he that took me out of the womb:</hi> It is God that hath preſerved them alive ever ſince they were born, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.8, 9. <hi>O bleſs our God, ye people,—who holdeth our Soul in life.</hi> And ſeeing God hath a far greater right to our Children than we have, ſhall we be diſcontented when he diſpoſeth of them as he ſeeth good? May not he ſay to us, when we repine at any thing that he doth to our children, as the good Houſholder ſaid to thoſe that murmured at him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.13, 15. <hi>Friend I do thee no wrong,—Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> And as our children are the works of his hands, ſo his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards his works, are beyond our mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that proceed from our bowels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works:</hi> He deſires their welfare both here and for ever, more than we can do, <hi>Job</hi> 14.15. —<hi>Thou wilt have a deſire to the work of thine hands:</hi> Deut. 5.29. <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever!</hi> Now if the Lord, whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, and who deſireth our Childrens welfare more than we our ſelves do, ſaw cauſe to caſt away the works of his own hands into eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall we by our diſcontent go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul God in what he hath done, as though we were wiſer or more merciful than He?</p>
                  <p>IV. Though there be a great depth in Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch as we can't ſearch out the reaſon of them, why ſometimes he converteth one, and leaveth another to periſh in his ſins, although both are born of the ſame Parents, and live under the ſame means
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102523:167"/>of grace; Yet he is always Juſt and Righteous, and True, and Faithful, in all his ways. The Apoſtle was a man of a deeper inſight into the myſteries of the Goſpel than we are, yet he confeſſeth ſome of Gods ways to be unſearchable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34. <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> Whatever Judgments God inflicts upon Nations, or particular Perſons, though we may not be able to fathom the reaſon of them, yet we muſt believe that all that the Righteous God doth, is Juſt and True, and that he never acts contrary to the Truth of his Word, or againſt the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. <hi>They ſing the Song of Moſes the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and the Song of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, Juſt and True are thy Ways, thou King of Saints.</hi> This Song was ſung upon the pouring out of the ſeven laſt Plagues, in which was filled up the Wrath of God, verſe 1. From hence it is evident that the Lord doth nothing beyond the Rules of Juſtice, or contrary to his Truth, when he poureth out his wrath to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt either upon a Nation, or upon particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. When the children of godly Parents ſin againſt God, and God caſteth them away for their ſins, he doth not by this act pervert Juſtice and Equity; <hi>Job</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>Doth God pervert Judgment? Or doth the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty pervert Juſtice; If thy Children have ſinned againſt him, and he have caſt them away for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion?</hi> Now when God doth thoſe things which are Juſt and Right, we ſhould be ſo far from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, that vve ſhould praiſe and honour God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vve our ſelves ſhould ſuffer deeply by thoſe Judgments. After <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was driven from his Throne, and forced to dwell among the Beaſts of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102523:167"/>the field, where he was wet with the dew of Heaven, and did eat graſs with the Oxen, when his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding returned to him again, although he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven years under this great and unuſual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he ſaw Juſtice and Truth in this ſtroke of God, he extolled and praiſed the Lord, <hi>Dan</hi> 4 37. <hi>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praiſe and extol and honour the King of Heaven, all whoſe Works are Truth, and his Ways are Judgment; and thoſe that walk in pride, he is able to abaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. God ſhall have eternal Glory from them that periſh, as well as from them that are ſaved: His Juſtice ſhall be glorified on them that periſh, and his Mercy in them that are ſaved. When ungodly ſinners are caſt into Hell in great multitudes, God is glorified in their deſtruction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.14, 16. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth, ſhall deſcend into it— But the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be exalted in Judgment, and God that is holy ſhall be ſanctified in Righteouſneſs.</hi> Now ſeeing God ſhall be glorified in them that periſh, this may quiet our minds, and keep down all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring thoughts, if it ſhould be our portion to have any of our children cut off in their ſins. <hi>Aaron</hi>'s two ſons, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> were cut off in the act of ſin, while they were offering ſtrange fire, there went out fire from the Lord and conſumed them, and they died before the Lord; yet when <hi>Aaron</hi> heard <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak of Gods being glorified, he was ſilent under this heavy ſtroke, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Then Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, This is that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be glorified: And Aaron held his peace.</hi> God made all things and all perſons, wicked as well as
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102523:168"/>good men, for his own glory: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf, yea even the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> And ſeeing God made all things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his own pleaſure and glory, he may glorifie himſelf according to his own will and pleaſure, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one of his creatures, and none may ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, What doeſt thou?</p>
                  <p>VI. The conſideration of the great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy of God in beſtowing his grace upon our ſouls, and taking us into his everlaſting Covenant, may quiet our minds, however it ſhall pleaſe him to deal with our Families. <hi>David</hi> met with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in his Family, ſome of his children proved perverſe and were very great croſſes to him, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a ſtate as he could have little or no hope of their ſalvation; <hi>Amnon</hi> was ſuch a vitious perſon that he raviſhed his own ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> and was ſlain when his heart was merry with wine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28. by this phraſe is ſignified that <hi>Amnon</hi> was little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than drunk when he was ſlain, as may be gathered from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36. where <hi>Nabals</hi> drunkenneſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by his heart being merry; <hi>Nabals heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Abſolom</hi> who had cauſed his Brother <hi>Amnon</hi> to be ſlain, roſe up in rebellion againſt his Father, and ſought to take his Kingdom and Life from him, and was cat off in this act of ſin? And how did <hi>David</hi> quiet himſelf under theſe great afflictions that befel his Houſe? It was with the Covenant that God had made with his own Soul, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102523:168"/>vation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> The mercies and bleſſings of the Covenant are ſo great, and ſuch unvaluable mercies, that when we conſide the riches of Gods grace, and his infinite love in taking our own ſouls into Covenant vvith himſelf; this conſideration may ſo fill our hearts vvith joy, as to ſwallow up all our ſorrows, ariſing either from perſonal or family-afflictions. Wine will chear ſuch as are of a ſorrowful ſpirit, and make them forget their miſeries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6, 7. <hi>Give ſtrong drink unto him that is ready to periſh, and wine to them that be of heavy hearts: Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> Gods love is better, and hath more efficacy to chear ſuch as are of heavy hearts, than wine; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. —<hi>Thy love is better than Wine:</hi> And if Wine will refreſh ſuch as are of ſorrowful ſpirits, yea ſuch as are ready to periſh under their affliction, what efficacy is there in the love of God, which he hath manifeſted in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſouls into Covenant, to comfort us under our greateſt ſorrows and miſeries, even ſuch as lie heavy upon our hearts, yea ſuch as vve think vve ſhall periſh under them?</p>

                  <p>TO theſe Conſiderations I ſhall add a Reply to ſuch Pleas as thoſe Parents whoſe Children have died in their ſins may poſſibly make uſe of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their immoderate grief and diſcontent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of mind, under this affliction of loſing their

                  <p>1 Plea. <hi>My Children that are dead in their ſins, are gone into everlaſting burnings, where their torments will be endleſs and intolerable; and it ſo pierceth my heart and diſtracteth my mind, when I think that thoſe that came out of my Bowels, my Children, for whom I had ſuch a dear affection, ſhould be caſt into the lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone, where they muſt remain for eternity; that I am not able to bear it, but ſometimes I am ready to fret againſt God; and at other times my heart is ſo full with grief, that I think it will break in pieces, and I ſhall die with ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. If your Children be caſt into eternal Torments for their ſins, it is God hath done it; He keeps the Keys of Death and Hell: No perſon is cut off by death, none after death are caſt into Hell, but at Gods appointment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I have the Keys of Hell and Death:</hi> There is not ſo much as one Sparrow falleth to the ground, but at the will and by the appointment of God: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Are not two Sparrows ſold for a farthing? And one of them ſhall not fall to the ground without your Father.</hi> If a Sparrow doth not fall to the ground vvithout the vvill of God, then ſurely an immortal Soul doth not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell Torments, but at his appointment: for the meaneſt Soul that ever was created, is of a thouſand times more value than many Sparrows. And ſeeing it is God hath done it, how grievous and bitter ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be unto your Souls, you muſt bear it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9, 10. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou diddeſt it:</hi> And this was no ſmall ſtroke under which <hi>David</hi> was dumb, becauſe the Lord gave him the blow; but it was ſo great, as that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102523:169"/>he was even conſumed with it, as the next words ſhew, <hi>Remove thy ſtroke away from me, I am conſumed by the blow of thine hand:</hi> By his being conſumed, we may underſtand the greatneſs of his grief, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.9. <hi>Mine eye is conſumed with grief, yea my ſoul and my belly;</hi> yet under this great ſtroke which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Soul and his Body with grief, he was dumb and opened not his mouth becauſe God did it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cometh from the hands of God, muſt be born with ſilence and ſubmiſſion to his will, although it be ſo ſharp and bitter, as that it will make us go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as long as vve live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.15. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? He hath ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it, I ſhall go ſoftly all my years in the bitterneſs of my Soul.</hi> And as vve muſt be patient under all our griefs, ſo we muſt contentedly bear vvhatever grievous things befal our children, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Wo is me for my hurt, my wound is grievous; but I ſaid, Truly this is a grief, and I muſt bear it—My Children are gone forth of me, and are not.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="2">II. God is righteous in vvhat he hath done to your Children, although he hath caſt them into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments.

The Angels are more glorious Creatures than the Souls of Men, yet vvhen they ſinned againſt God, the Lord did not ſpare them, but for their firſt ſin caſt them down into hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment:</hi> And that they ſhall be puniſhed in Hell vvith everlaſting torments, is evident from <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And this he did vvithout affording them any means of their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from their ſin and miſery, vvhich vvas granted to fallen man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For verily he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but he took on him the Seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Now ſeeing God caſt thoſe glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Angels, into eternal torments for their firſt tranſgreſſion, and did not ſpare them one day, or afford them any means of recovery after their fall, ſhall vve think that God deals hardly vvith the Sons of men, in condemning them to eternal torments, vvhenas he afforded them means of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gave them a long time and ſpace for their Repentance, vvaiting day after day, and year after year, for their returning to him?

                        <item>3. Sin is committed againſt an eternal God, againſt an infinitely holy, great, and glorious GOD, and therefore deſerveth an infinite and eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We do not underſtand, or at leaſt vve do not
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102523:170"/>conſider, what an odious thing Sin is, and what a great God the Lord is; and vvhat an infinite diſtance there is between the great and holy God, and a poor ſinful man, vvhen vve think that the Lord deals hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvith ſinners in puniſhing their ſins vvith eternal torments. What an hainous crime is it for man, who is but a poor vvorm made of duſt and aſhes, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, deſpiſe, and rebel againſt the great GOD of Heaven and Earth, vvho gave him his Being, and loadeth him vvith his Benefits every day? To tread the Laws of God under his feet, and to caſt his vvord behind his back, to ſlight all his Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to contemn all his offers of Grace and Mercy, and though he wait with much patience and long-ſuffering many days and years for his Repentance, to refuſe to return and obey the Voice of his Creator? Doth not ſuch a deſpiſing of the Eternal, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, Ever-Bleſſed God, deſerve to be puniſhed with eternal Torments?</item>
                        <item>4. It is accounted no injuſtice among men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a puniſhment of long continuance for a crime that was committed in a very ſhort time. If Murder, Adultery, Treaſon, or ſome other capital Offence, which was committed in the ſpace of a few minutes, be puniſhed with perpetual impriſonment, or perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual baniſhment, no man counts it injuſtice, or thinks the Offender is hardly dealt with, becauſe he is ſo long puniſh'd for an offence committed in ſo ſhort a time: Why then ſhould any man think that the Righteous God dealeth hardly or unjuſtly in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners with perpetual torments, for the ſins they committed thoſe few years they lived in the world?</item>
                        <item>5. It was their own choice to embrace eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death. God ſet before them Life and Death, He told them if they did evil, they ſhould die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102523:171"/>but if they would repent, and do that which is good in his ſight, they ſhould have everlaſting life; and he called upon them earneſtly, to chuſe Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Death: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15, 19. <hi>See, I have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you this day life and good, death and evil—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuſe life</hi>—He offered them Life in his Son, and they would not go unto him for it, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>And ye will not come to Me, that ye might have life.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted ſolemnly to them, that he was loth they ſhould die, and therefore pleaded with them, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And therefore they muſt blame themſelves, not the Lord, for their being caſt into eternal Torments.</item>
                        <item>6. Had they been permitted to have lived for ever upon the face of the Earth, they would have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever: <hi>The heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. They would always have gone on reſiſting the Spirit of God, and doing thoſe things which are grievous in the ſight of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10, 4, 5. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will not ſeek after God, God is not in all his thoughts; his ways are always grievous:</hi> Acts 7.51. <hi>Ye do always reſiſt the holy Ghoſt:</hi> They would continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have ſinned againſt God in their hearts and lives, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great upon the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> Time would have been ſo far from leading them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that the longer they had lived, they would have been the more ſubtil and obſtinate ſinners, and would have been longer accuſtomed to do evil; and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102523:171"/>the longer a man hath been accuſtomed to do evil, the harder it is to bring him to Repentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. Is there any inequality in puniſhing them for ever, who would have ſinned for ever? Now if God hath dealt righteouſly with your Children, why ſhould you fret or be diſquieted at the righteous dealings of the Juſt and Righteous God? Was it meet that the Lord ſhould have perverted Juſtice for your ſake, or the ſake of your Children?</item>

                  <p n="3">III. The Lord hath fulfilled his eternal counſel, and declared his truth and faithfulneſs in fulfilling his Threatnings denounced againſt impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by condemning your children, who died in their ſins, unto eternal torments: God hath plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in his holy Word, that it is his eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable purpoſe to caſt into eternal torments all wicked and ungodly perſons, that live and die in their ſins without Repentance. The Scriptures are full of Threatnings to this effect; as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41, 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. with a multitude of other places; why then ſhould you fret at Gods fulfilling his eternal counſel, and at his faithfulneſs in fulfilling his word? As <hi>Bildad</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job</hi> 18.4. <hi>He teareth himſelf in his anger, ſhall the Earth be forſaken for thee? And ſhall the Rock be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of his place?</hi> The like may I ſay to you, Why do you tear your ſelves in your anger? Should the Lord have forſaken his eternal counſels, which are more firm than the Earth or Rocks, and would have brought greater confuſion than the removing the Earth, or the Rocks out of their places, for your ſakes? Would you have had him altered the way and courſe of mans ſalvation for the ſake of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Would you have had him proved unfaithful in not fulfilling his word, to ſpare your Children
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102523:172"/>from eternal torments? This in effect is to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would have denied his own Being, and ceaſed to be God, rather than to have condemned your Children. For if God ſhould depart from his faithfulneſs, he ſhould deny his own Being, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Murmuring and fretting againſt God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning your Children, who died in their ſins, unto eternal torments, is the way to fall into the ſame condemnation with your Children. For thoſe that reſemble Dogs by their barking and ſnarling, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry at what God doth, ſhall be ſhut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Without are Dogs.</hi> The Apoſtle cautions us againſt murmuring, leſt we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by provoke God to deſtroy us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</hi> And therefore inſtead of murmuring againſt God for deſtroying your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, admire his great and wonderful mercy, that you as well as they are not conſumed, and caſt into everlaſting burnings, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. Your exceſſive ſorrow for your deceaſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who died in their ſins, doth not pleaſe God, nor any way benefit you or your children. It doth not pleaſe God, he is troubled that you do not joy more in having him for your God, and Portion, and Saviour, than you grieve at the loſs of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but that your grief for your children ſhould ſwallow up your joy in God; and may ſay to you as <hi>Elkanah</hi> did to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.8. <hi>Why weepeſt thou? And why eateſt thou not? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten ſons?</hi> When any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction exceedeth its due bounds, it is ſinful; and that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102523:172"/>which is ſinful diſpleaſeth God. Your exceſſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will no ways benefit your deceaſed, children. If you could ſhed Rivers of Tears for them, they would avail nothing for their Releaſe, or the miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their torments: Prayers and Tears may do great things for the Living, but they are not any way profitable for the Dead. And as Prayers and Tears profit dead men nothing, ſo neither can any other work that is done by any man under the Sun, be any way beneficial to the Dead. <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking of the dead, ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</hi> When once God hath paſſed ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for their eternal ſtate, no Creature can prevail with him to change his mind, <hi>Job</hi> 23.13. <hi>But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?</hi> Not one Soul that is caſt into hell can by any means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from thence again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.8. <hi>For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their ſoul is precious, and it ceaſeth for ever.</hi> And as your inordinate ſorrow doth not benefit your deceaſed children, ſo neither do you your ſelves reap any advantage by it; it is ſo far from doing you good, that it hurts you both in body, and ſoul, and eſtate: It hurts your bodies as it dries and conſumes them, and haſtens your death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.22. <hi>A bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpirit drieth the bones.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. <hi>The ſorrow of the world worketh death.</hi> It hurts your Souls, as it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders your communion with God, and your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that ſervice you owe to God, and tends to the deſtroying of the Kingdom of God in your Souls, which conſiſteth not only in righteouſneſs, but alſo in peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. It hurts your Eſtates, as it unfits you for the works of your Calling. And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your exceſſive grief doth not pleaſe God,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102523:173"/>nor benefit your Children or your ſelves, nor any other perſon, but you diſquiet your ſelves in vain, let this put a period to your immoderate ſorrows.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Turn your exceſſive ſorrowing for the loſs of your deceaſed Childrens ſouls into zealous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after the ſalvation of your own ſoul, and the ſouls of your ſurviving Children. Inſtead of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable mourning for the dead, riſe up and work out your own ſalvation, with fear and trembling, and ſave, if it be poſſible, all that are committed to your charge. As the Lord called off <hi>Samuel</hi> from mourning for <hi>Saul,</hi> to anoint an other King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Samuel, how long wilt thou mourn for Saul, ſeeing I have rejected him from reigning over Iſrael? Fill thine horn with oyl, and go,</hi> &amp;c. So he calls you off from mourning for your children, whom he hath rejected, to make ſure of your own and your ſurviving Relations Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Turn your indignation which is apt to ariſe in your hearts againſt God becauſe he hath caſt away your Childrens Souls, into indignation againſt ſin, which was the cauſe why God caſt away their Souls. Hate all ſin in your ſelves, and hate all ſin in others, with a perfect hatred, and never be reconciled to it as long as you live, for the miſchief that it hath done to you and your Children. Seek by way of holy revenge the utter deſtruction of all ſin. Root it out of your hearts, and of your Families, and do what you can to hinder it from growing any more.</p>

                     <hi>MY Children that died in their ſins, and are now gone down into everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, received their corrupt natures from me; I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to convey unto them their Original Sin, and their Original Sin cauſed their Actual Sins, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Damnation, and this troubles me ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I know not what to do, I am ready to curſe the day in which I entred into a married condition; I might have kept my ſelf ſingle, and then my wicked Children had never been born; and ſometimes I am ready to curſe my Parents who conveyed a ſinful nature unto me.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is true that Parents do convey ſinful natures to their Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi>

The Lord Jeſus honoured it with his Preſence, and working one of his firſt Miracles at a Marriage Feaſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2, 11. Though Parents convey ſinful natures to their Children, yet Marriage is no ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.28. <hi>But and if thou marry thou haſt not ſinned, and if a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin marry ſhe hath not ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. Your being inſtrumental to convey corrupt natures to your Children ſhould make you look more throughly into the odious nature of Original Sin, and to loath your ſelves, and to be deeply humbled for it, but it ſhould not make you to repine that you were inſtruments of bringing Children into the World, for Children are counted bleſſings of God, and the man is called happy that is full of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.3.6. <hi>So Children are an Heritage of the Lord.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a great ſin, and ought to be much lamented, that you ſhould be guilty of the loſs of your Childrens ſouls. And it is a wonderful thing that many Parents make ſo light of it, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are under a ſpirit of ſlumber and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial hardneſs of heart. How great an evil it is for Parents to be guilty of the bloud of their childrens ſouls, and how they ought to be affected with it I have ſhewn before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. But though this be a great ſin, a ſin to be lamented as long as you live, yet you muſt take heed of being ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow. Satan labours what he can to keep us under blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, and to hinder us for mourning for our ſins, but when he cannot do that, becauſe God hath opened our eyes, and affected our hearts with the ſight of our ſin and miſery, he will endeavour to make us mourn without meaſure, eſpecially if we have been great ſinners. The inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> committed a great ſin, ſuch as was not ſo much as named among the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. And till he was brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance the Apoſtle adviſeth the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to deal ſharply with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. but when he was humbled, the Apoſtle adviſeth the Church to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, and why? <hi>Leaſt perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though this be a mighty great and crying ſin for Parents by their evil example, or their neglect
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102523:175"/>to teach them, or by any other means to be guilty of the bloud of their Childrens ſouls, yet it is not an unpardonable ſin, but I may ſay of it as <hi>Shecaniah</hi> did to <hi>Ezra</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2. <hi>We have treſpaſſed againſt our God— Yet now there is hope in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael concerning this thing.</hi> By Faith and Repentance you may obtain forgiveneſs of this as well as of other ſins. The bloud of Chriſt being applied by Faith, cleanſeth us from all manner of ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> If Chriſts bloud cleanſeth from all ſin, then from being guilty of the bloud of ſouls, as well as from other ſins. The merits of Chriſts bloud are ſufficient to waſh away the ſins of the greateſt ſinners in the whole world, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> And all that believe in him ſhall for his ſake receive the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſins, of what nature ſoever they have been, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins; And by him all that believe are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from all things, from which we could not be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Such whoſe ſins are of the deepeſt die, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſcarlet and crimſon ſins, whoſe hands have been full of bloud, have the full and free remiſſion of all their ſins promiſed upon their repentance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Your hands are full of bloud, waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well—Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as ſcarlet they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon they ſhall be as wool.</hi>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102523:176"/>The Lord taxeth the Jews with the bloud of the Souls of poor Innocents, and telleth them their guilt herein was as evident as what appeareth upon a mans skirts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34. <hi>Alſo upon thy skirts is found the bloud of the ſouls of poor innocents</hi>— Yet to theſe Jews that were guilty of the bloud of ſouls of poor Innocents the Lord promiſeth mercy upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep mine anger for ever, only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God.</hi> Who were greater ſinners than they that ſhed the bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Yet even to them that were guilty of the bloud of Chriſt, the Lord promiſeth remiſſion of that, and all their other ſins upon their repentance. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.14, 15, 19. <hi>Ye denied the Holy One, and the Juſt, and deſired a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of life — Repent ye therefore, and be ye converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> The like we have alſo promiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23, 38, 39. where the Apoſtle tells them who had taken and with wicked hands had crucified and ſlain the Lord Jeſus, that they were not excluded from the promiſes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but that upon their repentance they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion of their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Teſtifie the truth of your repentance for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering your deceaſed Children to periſh through your negligence, by doubling your diligence in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what in you lieth to ſave the ſouls of your ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Children, and Servants, and all others under your charge, by praying to God for them night and day, and inſtructing them in the knowledge of thoſe

Though you did not convert your Children, yet you have delivered your own ſoul, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.19. <hi>If thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</hi> And the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of your own ſoul is worth all your pains, although you had taken a thouſand times more than you have done.</item>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Plea </seg>5</label> I <hi>Am much troubled to reconcile Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in caſting away my ſeed, with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, where he hath ſaid,</hi> I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed. <hi>Sometimes I am ready to queſtion Gods faithfulneſs, ſometimes I am ready to think that I my ſelf am not in Covenant with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. In all ſuch caſes where you are not able to reconcile Gods Providences with his Promiſes, you muſt ſtedfaſtly believe that God is faithful and righteous, although you cannot apprehend how ſuch or ſuch a Providence ſhould be conſiſtent with his faithfulneſs, or with his righteouſneſs. Thus <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did firmly believe that God was righteous, although he ſtumbled much at the proſperity of wicked men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments, Wherefore doth the way of the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly?</hi> The Pſalmiſt met with ſome Providences that ſeemed croſs to Gods faithfulneſs, <hi>Pſal</hi> 77.8. <hi>Doth his Promiſe fail for overmore?</hi> Pſal. 89.39, 49. <hi>Thou haſt made void the Covenant of thy Servant — Lord, where are thy former loving kindneſſes which thou ſweareſt unto David in thy truth?</hi> Yet he did believe every word of God to be true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.138, 160. <hi>Thy Teſtimones that thou haſt commanded are righteous and very faithful — Thy Word is true from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and every one of thy righteous judgments endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever.</hi> And there is good reaſon we ſhould
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102523:178"/>do thus, becauſe we poor finite Creatures are not able to comprehend the works of the infinite and incomprehenſible God. Divers of his Works, as well as his Eſſence, are incomprehenſible, <hi>Job</hi> 37.5. <hi>God thundreth marvelouſly with his voice, great things doth he which we cannot comprehend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is good for you to view once and again the grounds upon which you conclude God hath taken your ſouls into his Covenant, becauſe it is a buſineſs of great moment, wherein you cannot make too ſure work, and the heart of man is full of deceit; yet withal know this, that it is not a ſufficient cauſe for you to conclude, That God is not your God, and hath not taken you into this Covenant, becauſe you have had Children that died in their ſins, for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was in Covenant with God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.42. <hi>Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Iſaac:</hi> And yet <hi>Eſau, Iſaacs</hi> Son, lived and died a prophane man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17. <hi>Leſt there be any Fornicator, or prophane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat ſold his birth-right, for ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he was rejected, and found no place for repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. God fulfils his Promiſe in being the God of your Seed, if he take any of your Seed into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with himſelf, although he ſhould not beſtow his grace upon all of them.</p>

                        <item>1. Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the Promiſes made, he ſaith not unto ſeeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi>

Such as are Chriſts being given to him by the Father, and are in due time all drawn to him, <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams Seed, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Promiſe.</hi> This will take off the difficulty mentioned in the Plea about reconciling Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in caſting off your Seed, with his Promiſe, where he ſaith, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed;</hi> For God never caſts off any of that Seed which he hath given to his Son, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> John 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. If we underſtand that Promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed,</hi> of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and every godly mans natural Seed, and interpret the Promiſe conditionally, provided that thy Seed walk in the ſteps of thy Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. and walk before me with perfect and upright hearts, as I required thee to do when I promiſed to make my Covenant between me and thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. This alſo will reconcile Gods Providence with his Promiſe, and vindicate his faithfulneſs in condemning the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of godly Parents who live and die in their ſins. For it is their unfaithfulneſs in not fulfilling the Conditions of the Promiſe, that was the cauſe of their condemnation. Had they followed their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith, and godly Coverſations, God would have been their God as well as the God of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and have given them the ſame bleſſings he gave their Parents. <hi>David</hi> was a man in Covenant with God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Now theſe be the laſt words
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102523:179"/>of David—he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> yet he did not expect his ſeed ſhould be ſaved if they lived and died in their ſins. No, he told his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> plainly before his death, that if he expected the bleſſings of the Covenant, he muſt ſeek and ſerve God with a perfect heart, but if he forſook God, though he were <hi>Davids</hi> Son, God would caſt him off for ever, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.29. <hi>And thou Solomon, my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts and underſtandeth all the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thoughts; if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
